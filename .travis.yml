# We can't run these jobs in parallel yet because jobs destroy their workspace.
# To do this, we would have to deploy artifacts from each job somewhere, and
# retrieve them before the final deploy stage. Running them in the same job like
# this allows us to bypass that chaos, but slows the build obviously.
