Note that by adding\\n        items to this list yourself, you can dynamically select elements if you need to.\\n    </li>\\n</ul>\\n\\n<p>\\n    In the following example, we simply display the names of the selected users, but since we\\n    have access to the full objects, we could perform any operation we want on them.\\n</p>\\n\\n<div class=\\\"card card-block\\\">\\n    <p class=\\\"card-text username-list\\\">\\n        Selected users:\\n        <em *ngIf=\\\"selected.length == 0\\\">No user selected.</em>\\n        <span class=\\\"username\\\" *ngFor=\\\"let user of selected\\\">{{user.name}}</span>\\n    </p>\\n</div>\\n\\n<clr-datagrid [(clrDgSelected)]=\\\"selected\\\">\\n    <clr-dg-column>User ID</clr-dg-column>\\n    <clr-dg-column>Name</clr-dg-column>\\n    <clr-dg-column>Creation date</clr-dg-column>\\n    <clr-dg-column>Favorite color</clr-dg-column>\\n\\n    <clr-dg-row *clrDgItems=\\\"let user of users\\\" [clrDgItem]=\\\"user\\\">\\n        <clr-dg-cell>{{user.id}}</clr-dg-cell>\\n        <clr-dg-cell>{{user.name}}</clr-dg-cell>\\n        <clr-dg-cell>{{user.creation | date}}</clr-dg-cell>\\n        <clr-dg-cell>\\n            <span class=\\\"color-square\\\" [style.backgroundColor]=\\\"user.color\\\"></span>\\n        </clr-dg-cell>\\n    </clr-dg-row>\\n\\n    <clr-dg-footer>{{users.length}} users</clr-dg-footer>\\n</clr-datagrid>\\n\\n<clr-example [clrCode]=\\\"mainExample\\\" clrLanguage=\\\"html\\\"></clr-example>\\n\\n<p>\\n    If you need an easier access to the selected state of a row, without having to go through the entire array,\\n    we also provide a boolean <code class=\\\"clr-code\\\">[(clrDgSelected)]</code> two-way binding on the\\n    <code class=\\\"clr-code\\\">&lt;clr-dg-row&gt;</code> itself.

This is a\\n    very common case that we fully support.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    We expose events and hooks on all parts of the datagrid to make sure you can trigger any\\n    requests you need based on precise user actions. But an important thing to note is that when\\n    the server does handle pagination, it needs to also deal with sorting and filtering,\\n    because all three are tightly coupled. In light of this, we decided to expose a single global\\n    output <code class=\\\"clr-code\\\">(clrDgRefresh)</code> that emits the current \\\"state\\\" of the\\n    datagrid whenever it changes due to a user action or an external one. This state has the\\n    following format:\\n</p>\\n<clr-example [clrCode]=\\\"examples.stateInterface\\\" clrLanguage=\\\"typescript\\\"></clr-example>\\n<p>\\n    It contains all the information you need to send to the server in order to get the slice of\\n    data currently displayed. It even contains redundant information (\\n    <code class=\\\"clr-code\\\">page.to</code> and <code class=\\\"clr-code\\\">page.size</code> for instance),\\n    to make sure you have access to the most practical for you without extra processing.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    One important thing to note is that since you don't have all the data available at once, you\\n    cannot use the smart iterator\\n    <code class=\\\"clr-code\\\">*clrDgItems</code>: it would sort, filter and paginate a subset of the\\n    data that has already gone through all that. So all you need to do is to go back to a simple\\n    <code class=\\\"clr-code\\\">*ngFor</code>, which we support.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Finally, since server calls are involved, we need some way of notifying the user that his\\n    action has been acknowledged and that we are currently working on it. To this effect, we\\n    provide an input <code class=\\\"clr-code\\\">[clrDgLoading]</code> that you can use to display the\\n    datagrid in a loading state, while fetching data.\\n</p>\\n\\n<p>\\n    Here is an example showcasing all this with a fake server latency of 500ms. It also\\n    demonstrates how to adapt the state we emit when it does not match exactly your server's API:\\n    in this example, the filters are re-formatted from an array to a map.\\n</p>\\n\\n<clr-datagrid (clrDgRefresh)=\\\"refresh($event)\\\" [clrDgLoading]=\\\"loading\\\">\\n    <clr-dg-column>User ID</clr-dg-column>\\n    <clr-dg-column [clrDgField]=\\\"'name'\\\">Name</clr-dg-column>\\n    <clr-dg-column [clrDgField]=\\\"'creation'\\\">Creation date</clr-dg-column>\\n    <clr-dg-column [clrDgField]=\\\"'pokemon'\\\">Pokemon</clr-dg-column>\\n    <clr-dg-column [clrDgField]=\\\"'color'\\\">Favorite color</clr-dg-column>\\n\\n    <clr-dg-row *ngFor=\\\"let user of users\\\">\\n        <clr-dg-cell>{{user.id}}</clr-dg-cell>\\n        <clr-dg-cell>{{user.name}}</clr-dg-cell>\\n        <clr-dg-cell>{{user.creation | date}}</clr-dg-cell>\\n        <clr-dg-cell>{{user.pokemon.name}}</clr-dg-cell>\\n        <clr-dg-cell>\\n            <span class=\\\"color-square\\\" [style.backgroundColor]=\\\"user.color\\\"></span>\\n        </clr-dg-cell>\\n    </clr-dg-row>\\n\\n    <clr-dg-footer>\\n        {{pagination.firstItem + 1}} - {{pagination.lastItem + 1}}\\n        of {{total}} users\\n        <clr-dg-pagination #pagination [clrDgTotalItems]=\\\"total\\\"></clr-dg-pagination>\\n    </clr-dg-footer>\\n</clr-datagrid>\\n\\n<clr-example [clrCode]=\\\"examples.serverDrivenTS\\\" clrLanguage=\\\"typescript\\\"></clr-example>\\n<clr-example [clrCode]=\\\"examples.serverDrivenHTML\\\" clrLanguage=\\\"html\\\"></clr-example>\\n\"\n\n/***/ }),\n/* 1337 */\n/***/ (function(module, exports) {\n\nmodule.exports = \"<!--\\n  ~ Copyright (c) 2016 VMware, Inc.

These alerts are for notifying users that a particular component or area of the screen needs attention. Standard alerts have four levels, denoted by color and icon. From most to least severe, they are:</p>\\n\\n    <ul class=\\\"list\\\">\\n        <li>Error–a problem needs fixing</li>\\n        <li>Warning–an action might have a harmful outcome</li>\\n        <li>Info–a situation needs attention, at some point</li>\\n        <li>Success–a significant achievement occurred</li>\\n    </ul>\\n\\n    <p>Other choices for displaying messages are <a routerLink=\\\"/documentation/input-fields\\\">input field validations</a> and <a routerLink=\\\"/documentation/modals\\\">modals</a> . However, these components require users to take action before proceeding.</p>\\n\\n    <h3 id=\\\"placement-and-size\\\">Placement and Size</h3>\\n\\n    <p>Alert positioning should be contextual to the component or area to which it applies. For example, if the alert applies to the entire content area, place it at the top and span the width of that area.</p>\\n\\n    <p>Base the height of the alert (36 or 24 pixels) on its location. The larger alert is for use in the application’s main content area, modals, and wizards. The smaller alert is for use in cards.</p>\\n\\n    <h3 id=\\\"closing-alerts\\\">Closing Alerts</h3>\\n\\n    <p>A close button (X) serves as a method for users to acknowledge the alert. It also allows users to declutter the view. Omit the close button if the alert should be persistent.</p>\\n\\n    <h3 id=\\\"message-text\\\">Message Text</h3>\\n\\n    <p>Keep the message text short and concise. If combining multiple messages in a single alert, make sure that the messages are of the same type. Avoid mixing error and warning messages.</p>\\n\\n    <h3 id=\\\"stacking-alerts\\\">Stacking Alerts</h3>\\n\\n    <p>When showing multiple alerts, stack from most severe to least severe:</p>\\n\\n    <ol class=\\\"list\\\">\\n        <li>Error</li>\\n        <li>Warning</li>\\n        <li>Info</li>\\n        <li>Success</li>\\n    </ol>\\n\\n    <p>Stack up to three alerts. For more than three, consider an alternate pattern, such as displaying the information on another page.</p>\\n\\n    <h3 id=\\\"actions\\\">Actions</h3>\\n\\n    <p>You can display up to two actions in an alert. For more than two actions, use a dropdown menu, limiting the number of items to five.</p>\\n\\n    <p>The most common course of action goes at the top of the menu, destructive actions at the bottom. Avoid placing destructive actions directly in the alert.</p>\\n\\n    <p>Actions in standard alerts are represented by links because links take up less space than buttons and are light in appearance.\\n        <!-- One line is 36 pixels tall using links.

Placeholder text disappears when the user types in the field.</p>\\n\\n    <p>Tip: Use the label to show what information goes in the field and placeholder text as a hint, description, or example format:</p>\\n\\n    <p>Label: Airport\\n        <br /> Placeholder text: SFO, SJO</p>\\n\\n    <p>Placeholder text can replace labels only in simple forms with a few easily-understood fields, see the <a routerLink=\\\"/documentation/login\\\">login page</a>.</p>\\n\\n    <h4 id=\\\"disabled-fields\\\">Disabled Fields</h4>\\n\\n    <p>Show a disabled field only if the user can take a reasonable action to enable the component. When disabling a component, also disable all associated elements, such as the component label and explanatory text.</p>\\n\\n    <h4 id=\\\"button-placement\\\">Button Placement</h4>\\n\\n    <p>Button placement depends on form type and where it appears in the UI.

Some pages might benefit from a three-column layout, where other pages might work best with a two-column layout.</p>\\n\\n    <p>You can vary the column layout within the same page. This strategy works well for presenting content that scrolls vertically.</p>\\n\\n    <p>Don’t lock your design into a layout optimized for a large window.</p>\\n\\n    <h4 id=\\\"grids-and-card-layouts\\\">Grids and Card Layouts</h4>\\n\\n    <p>Designing to a grid is especially important for <a routerLink=\\\"/documentation/cards\\\">card</a> layouts. Cards contains blocks of content and their height and width can vary. The grid aligns the cards in a way that is easy for users to navigate.</p>\\n\\n    <h4 id=\\\"if-you-decide-not-to-conform-to-the-grid\\\">If You Decide Not to Conform to the Grid</h4>\\n\\n    <p>Do so with intent. Find a balance between aesthetics and conformity. Keep in mind that elements that are not aligned to the grid draw attention in the same way as color, contrast, and iconography and require more cognitive effort on the part of the\\n        user.</p>\\n</article>\"\n\n/***/ }),\n/* 1480 */\n/***/ (function(module, exports) {\n\nmodule.exports = \"<article>\\n    <h5 class=\\\"component-summary\\\" id=\\\"the-header-and-subnav-support-app-level-information-and-navigation-links\\\">The header and subnav support app-level information and navigation links.</h5>\\n\\n    <h3 id=\\\"header\\\">Header</h3>\\n\\n    <h6 id=\\\"header-1\\\">.header</h6>\\n\\n    <p><code class=\\\"clr-code\\\">.header</code> is a wrapper around the following four sections:</p>\\n\\n    <ul class=\\\"list\\\">\\n        <li>Branding</li>\\n        <li>Navigation</li>\\n        <li>Search</li>\\n        <li>Settings</li>\\n    </ul>\\n\\n    <h6 id=\\\"branding\\\">.branding</h6>\\n\\n    <p><code class=\\\"clr-code\\\">.branding</code> contains the product logo and the product title.

Don’t overcrowd the header with too many settings–consolidate them in a dropdown menu.</p>\\n\\n    <h4 id=\\\"colors\\\">Colors</h4>\\n\\n    <p>Headers have their own color palette. These colors make the header visually recede in focus so it does not compete with the content area.</p>\\n\\n    <p><img src=\\\"assets/images/documentation/header/Colors.png\\\" alt=\\\"Header Colors\\\" /></p>\\n\\n    <h3 id=\\\"using-the-subnav\\\">Using the Subnav</h3>\\n    <p>The subnav is recommended for either app-level navigation links or for links secondary to the ones in the header. For best use of the horizontal space, include five to seven links. Less than five might leave too much empty space.</p>\\n\\n    <p>Use text for the link names, not icons.

For easier access to the individual graphic parts of the icon, each piece of the glyph has a unique number identifier. For example,\\n        <code class=\\\"clr-code\\\">.clr-i-outline-path-3</code> targets the third path in the outlined version of an icon.\\n    </p>\\n\\n    <p>\\n        There are also a couple of common CSS classes that can help you target common elements.\\n        <code class=\\\"clr-code\\\">.clr-i-badge</code> targets the round dot in badged icons. Likewise, <code class=\\\"clr-code\\\">.clr-i-alert</code> targets the yellow triangle in alerted icons.

You can bind to as deep a property as you want in your model, using\\n    a standard dot-separated syntax:\\n    <code class=\\\"clr-code\\\">[clrDgField]=&quot;'my.deep.property'&quot;</code>\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    You can also see in the following example how every feature we offer is always opt-in:\\n    we did not declare any binding on the \\\"User ID\\\" column, which means it is not sortable of\\n    filterable.\\n</p>\\n\\n<clr-datagrid>\\n    <clr-dg-column>User ID</clr-dg-column>\\n    <clr-dg-column [clrDgField]=\\\"'name'\\\">Name</clr-dg-column>\\n    <clr-dg-column [clrDgField]=\\\"'creation'\\\">Creation date</clr-dg-column>\\n    <clr-dg-column [clrDgField]=\\\"'pokemon.name'\\\">Pokemon</clr-dg-column>\\n    <clr-dg-column [clrDgField]=\\\"'color'\\\">Favorite color</clr-dg-column>\\n\\n    <clr-dg-row *clrDgItems=\\\"let user of users\\\">\\n        <clr-dg-cell>{{user.id}}</clr-dg-cell>\\n        <clr-dg-cell>{{user.name}}</clr-dg-cell>\\n        <clr-dg-cell>{{user.creation | date}}</clr-dg-cell>\\n        <clr-dg-cell>{{user.pokemon.name}}</clr-dg-cell>\\n        <clr-dg-cell>\\n            <span class=\\\"color-square\\\" [style.backgroundColor]=\\\"user.color\\\"></span>\\n        </clr-dg-cell>\\n    </clr-dg-row>\\n\\n    <clr-dg-footer>{{users.length}} users</clr-dg-footer>\\n</clr-datagrid>\\n\\n<clr-example [clrCode]=\\\"example\\\" clrLanguage=\\\"html\\\"></clr-example>\\n\\n<div class=\\\"alert alert-warning\\\">\\n    <div class=\\\"alert-item\\\">\\n        <span class=\\\"alert-text\\\">\\n            In this example, the <code class=\\\"clr-code\\\">[clrDgField]</code> input is a hard-coded\\n            string, so it needs to be quoted twice:\\n            <code class=\\\"clr-code\\\">[clrDgField]=&quot;'name'&quot;</code>.\\n        </span>\\n    </div>\\n    <div class=\\\"alert-item\\\">\\n        <span>\\n            Another way to write this would be\\n            <code class=\\\"clr-code\\\">clrDgField=&quot;name&quot;</code>, without\\n            having the extra quotes, but we do not recommend this.

This is a\\n    very common case that we fully support.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    We expose events and hooks on all parts of the datagrid to make sure you can trigger any\\n    requests you need based on precise user actions. But an important thing to note is that when\\n    the server does handle pagination, it needs to also deal with sorting and filtering,\\n    because all three are tightly coupled. In light of this, we decided to expose a single global\\n    output <code class=\\\"clr-code\\\">(clrDgRefresh)</code> that emits the current \\\"state\\\" of the\\n    datagrid whenever it changes due to a user action or an external one. This state has the\\n    following format:\\n</p>\\n<clr-example [clrCode]=\\\"examples.stateInterface\\\" clrLanguage=\\\"typescript\\\"></clr-example>\\n<p>\\n    It contains all the information you need to send to the server in order to get the slice of\\n    data currently displayed. It even contains redundant information (\\n    <code class=\\\"clr-code\\\">page.to</code> and <code class=\\\"clr-code\\\">page.size</code> for instance),\\n    to make sure you have access to the most practical for you without extra processing.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    One important thing to note is that since you don't have all the data available at once, you\\n    cannot use the smart iterator\\n    <code class=\\\"clr-code\\\">*clrDgItems</code>: it would sort, filter and paginate a subset of the\\n    data that has already gone through all that. So all you need to do is to go back to a simple\\n    <code class=\\\"clr-code\\\">*ngFor</code>, which we support.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Finally, since server calls are involved, we need some way of notifying the user that his\\n    action has been acknowledged and that we are currently working on it. To this effect, we\\n    provide an input <code class=\\\"clr-code\\\">[clrDgLoading]</code> that you can use to display the\\n    datagrid in a loading state, while fetching data.\\n</p>\\n\\n<p>\\n    Here is an example showcasing all this with a fake server latency of 500ms. It also\\n    demonstrates how to adapt the state we emit when it does not match exactly your server's API:\\n    in this example, the filters are re-formatted from an array to a map.\\n</p>\\n\\n<clr-datagrid (clrDgRefresh)=\\\"refresh($event)\\\" [clrDgLoading]=\\\"loading\\\">\\n    <clr-dg-column>User ID</clr-dg-column>\\n    <clr-dg-column [clrDgField]=\\\"'name'\\\">Name</clr-dg-column>\\n    <clr-dg-column [clrDgField]=\\\"'creation'\\\">Creation date</clr-dg-column>\\n    <clr-dg-column [clrDgField]=\\\"'pokemon'\\\">Pokemon</clr-dg-column>\\n    <clr-dg-column [clrDgField]=\\\"'color'\\\">Favorite color</clr-dg-column>\\n\\n    <clr-dg-row *ngFor=\\\"let user of users\\\">\\n        <clr-dg-cell>{{user.id}}</clr-dg-cell>\\n        <clr-dg-cell>{{user.name}}</clr-dg-cell>\\n        <clr-dg-cell>{{user.creation | date}}</clr-dg-cell>\\n        <clr-dg-cell>{{user.pokemon.name}}</clr-dg-cell>\\n        <clr-dg-cell>\\n            <span class=\\\"color-square\\\" [style.backgroundColor]=\\\"user.color\\\"></span>\\n        </clr-dg-cell>\\n    </clr-dg-row>\\n\\n    <clr-dg-footer>\\n        {{pagination.firstItem + 1}} - {{pagination.lastItem + 1}}\\n        of {{total}} users\\n        <clr-dg-pagination #pagination [clrDgTotalItems]=\\\"total\\\"></clr-dg-pagination>\\n    </clr-dg-footer>\\n</clr-datagrid>\\n\\n<clr-example [clrCode]=\\\"examples.serverDrivenTS\\\" clrLanguage=\\\"typescript\\\"></clr-example>\\n<clr-example [clrCode]=\\\"examples.serverDrivenHTML\\\" clrLanguage=\\\"html\\\"></clr-example>\\n\"\n\n\n//////////////////\n// WEBPACK FOOTER\n// ./src/demos/datagrid/server-driven/server-driven.html\n// module id = 1336\n// module chunks = 0","module.exports = \"<!--\\n  ~ Copyright (c) 2016 VMware, Inc.

In these cases,\\n    you might want to specify a custom comparator to sort the column according to your needs.\\n    This can be done by providing a comparator through the\\n    <code class=\\\"clr-code\\\">[clrDgSortBy]</code> input, whether or not your column is declared as a\\n    <code class=\\\"clr-code\\\">clrDgField</code>, and will always take precedence over it if it is.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    A comparator is just an object that implements a <code class=\\\"clr-code\\\">compare</code> method\\n    that could be given as parameter to Javascript's native\\n    <code class=\\\"clr-code\\\">Array.sort()</code> function. In other words, if a and b are two\\n    elements being compared, then:\\n</p>\\n<ul>\\n    <li>\\n        if compare(a, b) is less than 0, a comes first,\\n    </li>\\n    <li>\\n        if compare(a, b) returns 0, leave a and b unchanged with respect to each other, but\\n        sorted with respect to all other items,\\n    </li>\\n    <li>\\n        if compare(a, b) is greater than 0, b comes first.\\n    </li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>\\n    The safest way to check that your types comply with our API is to have your comparator be an\\n    instance of a class that implement the <code class=\\\"clr-code\\\">Comparator</code> interface\\n    provided by Clarity.\\n</p>\\n<div class=\\\"alert alert-info\\\">\\n    <div class=\\\"alert-item\\\">\\n        <span class=\\\"alert-text\\\">\\n            Why use an object instead of the function directly?\\n        </span>\\n    </div>\\n    <div class=\\\"alert-item\\\">\\n        <span>\\n            Using an object implementing an interface allows strong type-checking, which is safer\\n            for your application.

These alerts are for notifying users that a particular component or area of the screen needs attention. Standard alerts have four levels, denoted by color and icon. From most to least severe, they are:</p>\\n\\n    <ul class=\\\"list\\\">\\n        <li>Error–a problem needs fixing</li>\\n        <li>Warning–an action might have a harmful outcome</li>\\n        <li>Info–a situation needs attention, at some point</li>\\n        <li>Success–a significant achievement occurred</li>\\n    </ul>\\n\\n    <p>Other choices for displaying messages are <a routerLink=\\\"/documentation/input-fields\\\">input field validations</a> and <a routerLink=\\\"/documentation/modals\\\">modals</a> . However, these components require users to take action before proceeding.</p>\\n\\n    <h3 id=\\\"placement-and-size\\\">Placement and Size</h3>\\n\\n    <p>Alert positioning should be contextual to the component or area to which it applies. For example, if the alert applies to the entire content area, place it at the top and span the width of that area.</p>\\n\\n    <p>Base the height of the alert (36 or 24 pixels) on its location. The larger alert is for use in the application’s main content area, modals, and wizards. The smaller alert is for use in cards.</p>\\n\\n    <h3 id=\\\"closing-alerts\\\">Closing Alerts</h3>\\n\\n    <p>A close button (X) serves as a method for users to acknowledge the alert. It also allows users to declutter the view. Omit the close button if the alert should be persistent.</p>\\n\\n    <h3 id=\\\"message-text\\\">Message Text</h3>\\n\\n    <p>Keep the message text short and concise. If combining multiple messages in a single alert, make sure that the messages are of the same type. Avoid mixing error and warning messages.</p>\\n\\n    <h3 id=\\\"stacking-alerts\\\">Stacking Alerts</h3>\\n\\n    <p>When showing multiple alerts, stack from most severe to least severe:</p>\\n\\n    <ol class=\\\"list\\\">\\n        <li>Error</li>\\n        <li>Warning</li>\\n        <li>Info</li>\\n        <li>Success</li>\\n    </ol>\\n\\n    <p>Stack up to three alerts. For more than three, consider an alternate pattern, such as displaying the information on another page.</p>\\n\\n    <h3 id=\\\"actions\\\">Actions</h3>\\n\\n    <p>You can display up to two actions in an alert. For more than two actions, use a dropdown menu, limiting the number of items to five.</p>\\n\\n    <p>The most common course of action goes at the top of the menu, destructive actions at the bottom. Avoid placing destructive actions directly in the alert.</p>\\n\\n    <p>Actions in standard alerts are represented by links because links take up less space than buttons and are light in appearance.\\n        <!-- One line is 36 pixels tall using links.

Placeholder text disappears when the user types in the field.</p>\\n\\n    <p>Tip: Use the label to show what information goes in the field and placeholder text as a hint, description, or example format:</p>\\n\\n    <p>Label: Airport\\n        <br /> Placeholder text: SFO, SJO</p>\\n\\n    <p>Placeholder text can replace labels only in simple forms with a few easily-understood fields, see the <a routerLink=\\\"/documentation/login\\\">login page</a>.</p>\\n\\n    <h4 id=\\\"disabled-fields\\\">Disabled Fields</h4>\\n\\n    <p>Show a disabled field only if the user can take a reasonable action to enable the component. When disabling a component, also disable all associated elements, such as the component label and explanatory text.</p>\\n\\n    <h4 id=\\\"button-placement\\\">Button Placement</h4>\\n\\n    <p>Button placement depends on form type and where it appears in the UI. See <a routerLink=\\\"/documentation/buttons\\\">buttons</a> for guidelines.</p>\\n\\n    <h4 id=\\\"validation\\\">Validation</h4>\\n\\n    <p>For information on validation, see <a routerLink=\\\"/documentation/input-fields\\\">input fields</a>.</p>\\n\\n    <h4 id=\\\"focus-and-navigation\\\">Focus and Navigation</h4>\\n\\n    <p>Provide auto focus in the first field by default.

Some pages might benefit from a three-column layout, where other pages might work best with a two-column layout.</p>\\n\\n    <p>You can vary the column layout within the same page. This strategy works well for presenting content that scrolls vertically.</p>\\n\\n    <p>Don’t lock your design into a layout optimized for a large window.</p>\\n\\n    <h4 id=\\\"grids-and-card-layouts\\\">Grids and Card Layouts</h4>\\n\\n    <p>Designing to a grid is especially important for <a routerLink=\\\"/documentation/cards\\\">card</a> layouts. Cards contains blocks of content and their height and width can vary. The grid aligns the cards in a way that is easy for users to navigate.</p>\\n\\n    <h4 id=\\\"if-you-decide-not-to-conform-to-the-grid\\\">If You Decide Not to Conform to the Grid</h4>\\n\\n    <p>Do so with intent. Find a balance between aesthetics and conformity. Keep in mind that elements that are not aligned to the grid draw attention in the same way as color, contrast, and iconography and require more cognitive effort on the part of the\\n        user.</p>\\n</article>\"\n\n\n//////////////////\n// WEBPACK FOOTER\n// ./src/pages/documentation/grid.html\n// module id = 1479\n// module chunks = 0","module.exports = \"<article>\\n    <h5 class=\\\"component-summary\\\" id=\\\"the-header-and-subnav-support-app-level-information-and-navigation-links\\\">The header and subnav support app-level information and navigation links.</h5>\\n\\n    <h3 id=\\\"header\\\">Header</h3>\\n\\n    <h6 id=\\\"header-1\\\">.header</h6>\\n\\n    <p><code class=\\\"clr-code\\\">.header</code> is a wrapper around the following four sections:</p>\\n\\n    <ul class=\\\"list\\\">\\n        <li>Branding</li>\\n        <li>Navigation</li>\\n        <li>Search</li>\\n        <li>Settings</li>\\n    </ul>\\n\\n    <h6 id=\\\"branding\\\">.branding</h6>\\n\\n    <p><code class=\\\"clr-code\\\">.branding</code> contains the product logo and the product title.

Alternately, include a text label, for example, a cloud icon and the text “Cloud Infrastructure.” You can also provide a tooltip that describes the function of the icon.</p>\\n\\n    <p>Don’t mix standalone icons with standalone text links.</p>\\n\\n    <h4 id=\\\"search-1\\\">Search</h4>\\n\\n    <p>Consider placement of Search as follows:</p>\\n\\n    <ul class=\\\"list\\\">\\n        <li>If the header includes navigation links, place Search to the immediate right of the links.</li>\\n        <li>If the header does not include navigation, make Search the central point.</li>\\n        <li>Otherwise, align Search on the right.</li>\\n    </ul>\\n\\n    <p>For larger screens, include placeholder text in the Search field to give users an example of a search query.</p>\\n\\n    <!--![Search](/clarity/images/documentation/header/Search_header.png)-->\\n\\n    <h4 id=\\\"settings\\\">Settings</h4>\\n\\n    <p>Settings are typically right-aligned.

Don’t overcrowd the header with too many settings–consolidate them in a dropdown menu.</p>\\n\\n    <h4 id=\\\"colors\\\">Colors</h4>\\n\\n    <p>Headers have their own color palette. These colors make the header visually recede in focus so it does not compete with the content area.</p>\\n\\n    <p><img src=\\\"assets/images/documentation/header/Colors.png\\\" alt=\\\"Header Colors\\\" /></p>\\n\\n    <h3 id=\\\"using-the-subnav\\\">Using the Subnav</h3>\\n    <p>The subnav is recommended for either app-level navigation links or for links secondary to the ones in the header. For best use of the horizontal space, include five to seven links. Less than five might leave too much empty space.</p>\\n\\n    <p>Use text for the link names, not icons.
