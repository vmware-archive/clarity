This is a\\n    very common case that we fully support.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    We expose events and hooks on all parts of the datagrid to make sure you can trigger any\\n    requests you need based on precise user actions. But an important thing to note is that when\\n    the server does handle pagination, it needs to also deal with sorting and filtering,\\n    because all three are tightly coupled. In light of this, we decided to expose a single global\\n    output <code class=\\\"clr-code\\\">(clrDgRefresh)</code> that emits the current \\\"state\\\" of the\\n    datagrid whenever it changes due to a user action or an external one. This state has the\\n    following format:\\n</p>\\n<clr-example [clrCode]=\\\"examples.stateInterface\\\" clrLanguage=\\\"typescript\\\"></clr-example>\\n<p>\\n    It contains all the information you need to send to the server in order to get the slice of\\n    data currently displayed. It even contains redundant information (\\n    <code class=\\\"clr-code\\\">page.to</code> and <code class=\\\"clr-code\\\">page.size</code> for instance),\\n    to make sure you have access to the most practical for you without extra processing.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    One important thing to note is that since you don't have all the data available at once, you\\n    cannot use the smart iterator\\n    <code class=\\\"clr-code\\\">*clrDgItems</code>: it would sort, filter and paginate a subset of the\\n    data that has already gone through all that. So all you need to do is to go back to a simple\\n    <code class=\\\"clr-code\\\">*ngFor</code>, which we support.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Finally, since server calls are involved, we need some way of notifying the user that his\\n    action has been acknowledged and that we are currently working on it. To this effect, we\\n    provide an input <code class=\\\"clr-code\\\">[clrDgLoading]</code> that you can use to display the\\n    datagrid in a loading state, while fetching data.\\n</p>\\n\\n<p>\\n    Here is an example showcasing all this with a fake server latency of 500ms. It also\\n    demonstrates how to adapt the state we emit when it does not match exactly your server's API:\\n    in this example, the filters are re-formatted from an array to a map.\\n</p>\\n\\n<clr-datagrid (clrDgRefresh)=\\\"refresh($event)\\\" [clrDgLoading]=\\\"loading\\\">\\n    <clr-dg-column>User ID</clr-dg-column>\\n    <clr-dg-column [clrDgField]=\\\"'name'\\\">Name</clr-dg-column>\\n    <clr-dg-column [clrDgField]=\\\"'creation'\\\">Creation date</clr-dg-column>\\n    <clr-dg-column [clrDgField]=\\\"'pokemon'\\\">Pokemon</clr-dg-column>\\n    <clr-dg-column [clrDgField]=\\\"'color'\\\">Favorite color</clr-dg-column>\\n\\n    <clr-dg-row *ngFor=\\\"let user of users\\\">\\n        <clr-dg-cell>{{user.id}}</clr-dg-cell>\\n        <clr-dg-cell>{{user.name}}</clr-dg-cell>\\n        <clr-dg-cell>{{user.creation | date}}</clr-dg-cell>\\n        <clr-dg-cell>{{user.pokemon.name}}</clr-dg-cell>\\n        <clr-dg-cell>\\n            <span class=\\\"color-square\\\" [style.backgroundColor]=\\\"user.color\\\"></span>\\n        </clr-dg-cell>\\n    </clr-dg-row>\\n\\n    <clr-dg-footer>\\n        {{pagination.firstItem + 1}} - {{pagination.lastItem + 1}}\\n        of {{total}} users\\n        <clr-dg-pagination #pagination [clrDgTotalItems]=\\\"total\\\"></clr-dg-pagination>\\n    </clr-dg-footer>\\n</clr-datagrid>\\n\\n<clr-example [clrCode]=\\\"examples.serverDrivenTS\\\" clrLanguage=\\\"typescript\\\"></clr-example>\\n<clr-example [clrCode]=\\\"examples.serverDrivenHTML\\\" clrLanguage=\\\"html\\\"></clr-example>\\n\"\n\n/***/ },\n/* 1307 */\n/***/ function(module, exports) {\n\nmodule.exports = \"<!--\\n  ~ Copyright (c) 2016 VMware, Inc.

These alerts are for notifying users that a particular component or area of the screen needs attention. Standard alerts have four levels, denoted by color and icon. From most to least severe, they are:</p>\\n\\n    <ul class=\\\"list\\\">\\n        <li>Error–a problem needs fixing</li>\\n        <li>Warning–an action might have a harmful outcome</li>\\n        <li>Info–a situation needs attention, at some point</li>\\n        <li>Success–a significant achievement occurred</li>\\n    </ul>\\n\\n    <p>Other choices for displaying messages are <a routerLink=\\\"/documentation/input-fields\\\">input field validations</a> and <a routerLink=\\\"/documentation/modals\\\">modals</a> . However, these components require users to take action before proceeding.</p>\\n\\n    <h3 id=\\\"placement-and-size\\\">Placement and Size</h3>\\n\\n    <p>Alert positioning should be contextual to the component or area to which it applies. For example, if the alert applies to the entire content area, place it at the top and span the width of that area.</p>\\n\\n    <p>Base the height of the alert (36 or 24 pixels) on its location. The larger alert is for use in the application’s main content area, modals, and wizards. The smaller alert is for use in cards.</p>\\n\\n    <h3 id=\\\"closing-alerts\\\">Closing Alerts</h3>\\n\\n    <p>A close button (X) serves as a method for users to acknowledge the alert. It also allows users to declutter the view. Omit the close button if the alert should be persistent.</p>\\n\\n    <h3 id=\\\"message-text\\\">Message Text</h3>\\n\\n    <p>Keep the message text short and concise. If combining multiple messages in a single alert, make sure that the messages are of the same type. Avoid mixing error and warning messages.</p>\\n\\n    <h3 id=\\\"stacking-alerts\\\">Stacking Alerts</h3>\\n\\n    <p>When showing multiple alerts, stack from most severe to least severe:</p>\\n\\n    <ol class=\\\"list\\\">\\n        <li>Error</li>\\n        <li>Warning</li>\\n        <li>Info</li>\\n        <li>Success</li>\\n    </ol>\\n\\n    <p>Stack up to three alerts. For more than three, consider an alternate pattern, such as displaying the information on another page.</p>\\n\\n    <h3 id=\\\"actions\\\">Actions</h3>\\n\\n    <p>You can display up to two actions in an alert. For more than two actions, use a dropdown menu, limiting the number of items to five.</p>\\n\\n    <p>The most common course of action goes at the top of the menu, destructive actions at the bottom. Avoid placing destructive actions directly in the alert.</p>\\n\\n    <p>Actions in standard alerts are represented by links because links take up less space than buttons and are light in appearance.\\n        <!-- One line is 36 pixels tall using links.  With flat buttons, the line is taller to accommodate the button state change. -->\\n    </p>\\n\\n    <h3 id=\\\"color\\\">Color</h3>\\n\\n    <p>Alerts have their own color palette of red, yellow, green, and blue. They are not styled with Stoplight colors to avoid competition with call-to-action buttons.</p>\\n\\n    <h2 id=\\\"using-app-level-alerts\\\">Using App-Level Alerts</h2>\\n\\n    <p>An app-level alert appears at the top of the screen, above the application header. This alert is reserved for a single, system-level message.</p>\\n\\n    <p>App-level alerts have three severity levels:</p>\\n\\n    <table class=\\\"table .table-noborder \\\">\\n        <tr>\\n            <th class=\\\"left\\\">Type</th>\\n            <th class=\\\"left\\\">Example</th>\\n        </tr>\\n        <tr>\\n            <td class=\\\"left\\\">Error</td>\\n            <td class=\\\"left\\\">A problem exists with a server</td>\\n        </tr>\\n        <tr>\\n            <td class=\\\"left\\\">Warning</td>\\n            <td class=\\\"left\\\">A license is about to expire</td>\\n        </tr>\\n        <tr>\\n            <td valign=\\\"top\\\" class=\\\"left\\\">Info</td>\\n            <td class=\\\"left\\\"> A trial is about to end<br /> Support is required for a feature </td>\\n        </tr>\\n    </table>\\n\\n    <h3 id=\\\"guidelines\\\">Guidelines</h3>\\n\\n    <ul class=\\\"list\\\">\\n        <li>Show only one app-level alert at a time.</li>\\n        <li>Keep the message text to one line–don’t wrap the text.</li>\\n        <li>Include up to two actions and keep button labels concise.</li>\\n        <li>Do not include a menu within the alert.</li>\\n        <li>When appropriate, include a close icon so that the app-level alert can be dismissed.</li>\\n    </ul>\\n</article>\"\n\n/***/ },\n/* 1429 */\n/***/ function(module, exports) {\n\nmodule.exports = \"<article>\\n    <h5 class=\\\"component-summary\\\" id=\\\"a-properly-structured-layout-enforces-an-optimal-consistent-experience-across-applications\\\">A properly structured layout enforces an optimal, consistent experience across applications.</h5>\\n\\n    <h3 id=\\\"layout\\\">Layout</h3>\\n\\n    <p><strong>.main-container:</strong></p>\\n    <div>\\n        The <code class=\\\"clr-code\\\">.main-container</code> is a vertical flexbox which wraps the following components:\\n        <ul class=\\\"list\\\">\\n            <li><a routerLink=\\\"/documentation/alerts\\\">App-Level Alert</a></li>\\n            <li><a routerLink=\\\"/documentation/header\\\">Header</a></li>\\n            <li><a routerLink=\\\"/documentation/header\\\">Subnav</a></li>\\n            <li>Content Container</li>\\n        </ul>\\n    </div>\\n\\n    <p><strong>Note:</strong> Although Clarity does not have a footer component, a custom footer can be added in the main-container.</p>\\n\\n    <p><strong>.content-container:</strong></p>\\n    <div>\\n        The <code class=\\\"clr-code\\\">.content-container</code> is a horizontal flexbox which wraps the following components:\\n        <ul class=\\\"list\\\">\\n            <li>Content Area</li>\\n            <li><a routerLink=\\\"/documentation/sidenav\\\">Sidenav</a></li>\\n        </ul>\\n    </div>\\n\\n    <clr-layout-all-demo></clr-layout-all-demo>\\n\\n    <h3 id=\\\"guidelines\\\">Basic Structure</h3>\\n\\n    <p>Two constants of an app built in Clarity are the header and content area.

Often, these actions navigate to a new location. For example, you might have a Settings dropdown that changes context to provide\\n        logout, account settings, and so on.</p>\\n\\n    <p>Don’t confuse dropdowns with <a routerLink=\\\"/documentation/select-boxes\\\">select boxes</a>, which also present a list of choices. Select boxes are for data input within forms whereas dropdowns are for navigating outside of the existing context.</p>\\n\\n    <h4 id=\\\"behavior\\\">Behavior</h4>\\n\\n    <p>Users open a dropdown by clicking its toggle. By default, selecting a menu item or clicking outside the menu dismisses the menu. You can change this behavior so that the menu remains open on item selection.</p>\\n\\n    <h4 id=\\\"placement\\\">Placement</h4>\\n\\n    <p>By default, a dropdown opens from the bottom of the toggle, along the left side. You can change the placement by using one of the eight direction classes.</p>\\n\\n    <h4 id=\\\"menu-toggle\\\">Menu Toggle</h4>\\n\\n    <p>Clarity recommends that you use a button for the toggle. The button can contain either text or an icon.</p>\\n\\n    <h4 id=\\\"menu-items\\\">Menu Items</h4>\\n\\n    <p>Order menu items by usage, except for destructive actions, which belong at the bottom.

A grid-based approach:</p>\\n\\n    <ul class=\\\"list\\\">\\n        <li>Aligns content consistently</li>\\n        <li>Establishes a foundation that can be easily built upon for future designs</li>\\n        <li>Simplifies layout decisions required of a designer</li>\\n        <li>Coordinates the efforts of multiple designers</li>\\n    </ul>\\n\\n    <h4 id=\\\"applying-the-grid\\\">Applying the Grid</h4>\\n\\n    <p>Apply the grid with consideration of content. Some pages might benefit from a three-column layout, where other pages might work best with a two-column layout.</p>\\n\\n    <p>You can vary the column layout within the same page. This strategy works well for presenting content that scrolls vertically.</p>\\n\\n    <p>Don’t lock your design into a layout optimized for a large window.</p>\\n\\n    <h4 id=\\\"grids-and-card-layouts\\\">Grids and Card Layouts</h4>\\n\\n    <p>Designing to a grid is especially important for <a routerLink=\\\"/documentation/cards\\\">card</a> layouts. Cards contains blocks of content and their height and width can vary. The grid aligns the cards in a way that is easy for users to navigate.</p>\\n\\n    <h4 id=\\\"if-you-decide-not-to-conform-to-the-grid\\\">If You Decide Not to Conform to the Grid</h4>\\n\\n    <p>Do so with intent. Find a balance between aesthetics and conformity. Keep in mind that elements that are not aligned to the grid draw attention in the same way as color, contrast, and iconography and require more cognitive effort on the part of the\\n        user.</p>\\n</article>\"\n\n/***/ },\n/* 1440 */\n/***/ function(module, exports) {\n\nmodule.exports = \"<article>\\n    <h5 class=\\\"component-summary\\\" id=\\\"the-header-and-subnav-support-app-level-information-and-navigation-links\\\">The header and subnav support app-level information and navigation links.</h5>\\n\\n    <h3 id=\\\"header\\\">Header</h3>\\n\\n    <h6 id=\\\"header-1\\\">.header</h6>\\n\\n    <p><code class=\\\"clr-code\\\">.header</code> is a wrapper around the following four sections:</p>\\n\\n    <ul class=\\\"list\\\">\\n        <li>Branding</li>\\n        <li>Navigation</li>\\n        <li>Search</li>\\n        <li>Settings</li>\\n    </ul>\\n\\n    <h6 id=\\\"branding\\\">.branding</h6>\\n\\n    <p><code class=\\\"clr-code\\\">.branding</code> contains the product logo and the product title.

Clicking on the product name should return the user to the home page.</p>\\n\\n    <h4 id=\\\"navigation\\\">Navigation</h4>\\n\\n    <p>The header works best for two to four links. For less than two, navigation is not needed. For more than four, use the subnav or <a routerLink=\\\"/documentation/sidenav\\\">sidenav</a>. Although users commonly look for app-level navigation in the header,\\n        having too many main links can cause navigation to lose its meaning.</p>\\n\\n    <h4 id=\\\"text-links\\\">Text Links</h4>\\n\\n    <p>The preferred format of navigation links is text because it is generally better understood than icons. Use one to two words per link, with a limit of 16 characters. Do not wrap text.</p>\\n\\n    <h4 id=\\\"icon-links\\\">Icon Links</h4>\\n\\n    <p>Ensure that the icons are clearly recognizable, for example, Search. Alternately, include a text label, for example, a cloud icon and the text “Cloud Infrastructure.” You can also provide a tooltip that describes the function of the icon.</p>\\n\\n    <p>Don’t mix standalone icons with standalone text links.</p>\\n\\n    <h4 id=\\\"search-1\\\">Search</h4>\\n\\n    <p>Consider placement of Search as follows:</p>\\n\\n    <ul class=\\\"list\\\">\\n        <li>If the header includes navigation links, place Search to the immediate right of the links.</li>\\n        <li>If the header does not include navigation, make Search the central point.</li>\\n        <li>Otherwise, align Search on the right.</li>\\n    </ul>\\n\\n    <p>For larger screens, include placeholder text in the Search field to give users an example of a search query.</p>\\n\\n    <!--![Search](/clarity/images/documentation/header/Search_header.png)-->\\n\\n    <h4 id=\\\"settings\\\">Settings</h4>\\n\\n    <p>Settings are typically right-aligned. These might include app-related actions such as help and logout. Don’t overcrowd the header with too many settings–consolidate them in a dropdown menu.</p>\\n\\n    <h4 id=\\\"colors\\\">Colors</h4>\\n\\n    <p>Headers have their own color palette. These colors make the header visually recede in focus so it does not compete with the content area.</p>\\n\\n    <p><img src=\\\"assets/images/documentation/header/Colors.png\\\" alt=\\\"Header Colors\\\" /></p>\\n\\n    <h3 id=\\\"using-the-subnav\\\">Using the Subnav</h3>\\n    <p>The subnav is recommended for either app-level navigation links or for links secondary to the ones in the header. For best use of the horizontal space, include five to seven links. Less than five might leave too much empty space.</p>\\n\\n    <p>Use text for the link names, not icons.

The component exposes two methods (<code class=\\\"clr-code\\\">skipTab</code> and\\n        <code class=\\\"clr-code\\\">unSkipTab</code>) to skip or un-skip a step. In order to use the methods, you will have to specify a unique id as an input (\\n        <code class=\\\"clr-code\\\">clrWizardStepId</code>) and pass that value into the methods. You can also set the input <code class=\\\"clr-code\\\">clrWizardStepIsSkipped</code> and the corresponding <code class=\\\"clr-code\\\">clrWizardPageIsSkipped</code> to\\n        skip the step and the matching page as shown in the example below.</p>\\n\\n    <h4 id=\\\"overriding-the-title-in-the-wizard-page\\\">Overriding the Title in the Wizard Page</h4>\\n\\n    <p>By default, the page on the right-hand side will display the same title as the text that is inside the <code class=\\\"clr-code\\\">&lt;clr-wizard-step&gt;</code>. You may wish to override this for the matching page. You can do this by including an element\\n        inside the\\n        <code class=\\\"clr-code\\\">&lt;clr-wizard-page&gt;</code> with class <code class=\\\"clr-code\\\">.wizard-page-title</code> as shown in the example below.</p>\\n\\n    <clr-wizard-simple></clr-wizard-simple>\\n\\n    <h3 id=\\\"wizard-with-form-validation\\\">Wizard with Form Validation</h3>\\n\\n    <p>You can use form validation with the wizard.

A wizard simplifies the workflow by directing users serially through the tasks.</p>\\n\\n    <p>If the user doesn’t need to complete the workflow in a predefined order, use a <a routerLink=\\\"/documentation/modals\\\">modal</a> instead.</p>\\n\\n    <h4 id=\\\"base-wizard-size-on-use-case\\\">Base Wizard size on use case</h4>\\n\\n    <p>BSizes are 576 px, 864 px and 1056 px (default). The best design provides a good balance between white space and the number of elements per page. Overloading a page with too many controls can be a problem as can having many sparsely-populated pages.</p>\\n\\n    <h4 id=\\\"title\\\">Title</h4>\\n\\n    <p>Typically task-based, the title should summarize the workflow, for example, Create Hardware Profile.</p>\\n\\n    <h4 id=\\\"steps\\\">Steps</h4>\\n    <div class=\\\"row buttons-modal-gfx\\\">\\n        <div class=\\\"col-md-6 col-sm-12 flex-xs-middle\\\">\\n            <img src=\\\"assets/images/documentation/wizards/New_wizard.png\\\" alt=\\\"Buttons on inner wizard pages\\\" style=\\\"max-width:100%;\\\" />\\n        </div>\\n\\n        <div class=\\\"col-md-5 offset-md-1 col-sm-12 clrweb-wizardsteps-block\\\">\\n            <h4>Streamline the number of steps</h4>\\n            <p>\\n                A wizard should be at least two steps. Otherwise, a modal will suffice. Also, avoid vertical scrolling of steps. At the default size, the steps scroll at 14 lines.\\n            </p>\\n\\n            <h4>Non-branching wizards are preferable</h4>\\n            <p>\\n                However, if a user choice results in a change in the number of steps, make the change early in the workflow. Otherwise, users might lose track of the navigation path.\\n            </p>\\n\\n            <h4>Steps titles should be concise and direct</h4>\\n            <p>\\n                To help readers scan the text, use sentence-style caps and no ending punctuation. Avoid text that is so long it wraps to the next line.\\n            </p>\\n        </div>\\n    </div>\\n\\n    <h4 id=\\\"pages\\\">Pages</h4>\\n\\n    <h6 id=\\\"use-the-header-to-set-context\\\">Use the header to set context</h6>\\n\\n    <p>By default, the page header is the same text as the selected step.

The title and buttons remain in place when the content scrolls.</p>\\n\\n    <p>Clarity does not use horizontal lines to define the scrollable area. This keeps the UI clean and simple. Also, a line above the buttons makes it appear as if all content is visible.</p>\\n\\n    <h6 id=\\\"validation\\\">Validation</h6>\\n\\n    <p>Validation of user input can occur at the field level, the page level, and when the user finishes the wizard.

Note that by adding\\n        items to this list yourself, you can dynamically select elements if you need to.\\n    </li>\\n</ul>\\n\\n<p>\\n    In the following example, we simply display the names of the selected users, but since we\\n    have access to the full objects, we could perform any operation we want on them.\\n</p>\\n\\n<div class=\\\"card card-block\\\">\\n    <p class=\\\"card-text username-list\\\">\\n        Selected users:\\n        <em *ngIf=\\\"selected.length == 0\\\">No user selected.</em>\\n        <span class=\\\"username\\\" *ngFor=\\\"let user of selected\\\">{{user.name}}</span>\\n    </p>\\n</div>\\n\\n<clr-datagrid [(clrDgSelected)]=\\\"selected\\\">\\n    <clr-dg-column>User ID</clr-dg-column>\\n    <clr-dg-column>Name</clr-dg-column>\\n    <clr-dg-column>Creation date</clr-dg-column>\\n    <clr-dg-column>Favorite color</clr-dg-column>\\n\\n    <clr-dg-row *clrDgItems=\\\"let user of users\\\" [clrDgItem]=\\\"user\\\">\\n        <clr-dg-cell>{{user.id}}</clr-dg-cell>\\n        <clr-dg-cell>{{user.name}}</clr-dg-cell>\\n        <clr-dg-cell>{{user.creation | date}}</clr-dg-cell>\\n        <clr-dg-cell>\\n            <span class=\\\"color-square\\\" [style.backgroundColor]=\\\"user.color\\\"></span>\\n        </clr-dg-cell>\\n    </clr-dg-row>\\n\\n    <clr-dg-footer>{{users.length}} users</clr-dg-footer>\\n</clr-datagrid>\\n\\n<clr-example [clrCode]=\\\"mainExample\\\" clrLanguage=\\\"html\\\"></clr-example>\\n\\n<p>\\n    If you need an easier access to the selected state of a row, without having to go through the entire array,\\n    we also provide a boolean <code class=\\\"clr-code\\\">[(clrDgSelected)]</code> two-way binding on the\\n    <code class=\\\"clr-code\\\">&lt;clr-dg-row&gt;</code> itself.

This is a\\n    very common case that we fully support.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    We expose events and hooks on all parts of the datagrid to make sure you can trigger any\\n    requests you need based on precise user actions. But an important thing to note is that when\\n    the server does handle pagination, it needs to also deal with sorting and filtering,\\n    because all three are tightly coupled. In light of this, we decided to expose a single global\\n    output <code class=\\\"clr-code\\\">(clrDgRefresh)</code> that emits the current \\\"state\\\" of the\\n    datagrid whenever it changes due to a user action or an external one. This state has the\\n    following format:\\n</p>\\n<clr-example [clrCode]=\\\"examples.stateInterface\\\" clrLanguage=\\\"typescript\\\"></clr-example>\\n<p>\\n    It contains all the information you need to send to the server in order to get the slice of\\n    data currently displayed. It even contains redundant information (\\n    <code class=\\\"clr-code\\\">page.to</code> and <code class=\\\"clr-code\\\">page.size</code> for instance),\\n    to make sure you have access to the most practical for you without extra processing.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    One important thing to note is that since you don't have all the data available at once, you\\n    cannot use the smart iterator\\n    <code class=\\\"clr-code\\\">*clrDgItems</code>: it would sort, filter and paginate a subset of the\\n    data that has already gone through all that. So all you need to do is to go back to a simple\\n    <code class=\\\"clr-code\\\">*ngFor</code>, which we support.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    Finally, since server calls are involved, we need some way of notifying the user that his\\n    action has been acknowledged and that we are currently working on it. To this effect, we\\n    provide an input <code class=\\\"clr-code\\\">[clrDgLoading]</code> that you can use to display the\\n    datagrid in a loading state, while fetching data.\\n</p>\\n\\n<p>\\n    Here is an example showcasing all this with a fake server latency of 500ms. It also\\n    demonstrates how to adapt the state we emit when it does not match exactly your server's API:\\n    in this example, the filters are re-formatted from an array to a map.\\n</p>\\n\\n<clr-datagrid (clrDgRefresh)=\\\"refresh($event)\\\" [clrDgLoading]=\\\"loading\\\">\\n    <clr-dg-column>User ID</clr-dg-column>\\n    <clr-dg-column [clrDgField]=\\\"'name'\\\">Name</clr-dg-column>\\n    <clr-dg-column [clrDgField]=\\\"'creation'\\\">Creation date</clr-dg-column>\\n    <clr-dg-column [clrDgField]=\\\"'pokemon'\\\">Pokemon</clr-dg-column>\\n    <clr-dg-column [clrDgField]=\\\"'color'\\\">Favorite color</clr-dg-column>\\n\\n    <clr-dg-row *ngFor=\\\"let user of users\\\">\\n        <clr-dg-cell>{{user.id}}</clr-dg-cell>\\n        <clr-dg-cell>{{user.name}}</clr-dg-cell>\\n        <clr-dg-cell>{{user.creation | date}}</clr-dg-cell>\\n        <clr-dg-cell>{{user.pokemon.name}}</clr-dg-cell>\\n        <clr-dg-cell>\\n            <span class=\\\"color-square\\\" [style.backgroundColor]=\\\"user.color\\\"></span>\\n        </clr-dg-cell>\\n    </clr-dg-row>\\n\\n    <clr-dg-footer>\\n        {{pagination.firstItem + 1}} - {{pagination.lastItem + 1}}\\n        of {{total}} users\\n        <clr-dg-pagination #pagination [clrDgTotalItems]=\\\"total\\\"></clr-dg-pagination>\\n    </clr-dg-footer>\\n</clr-datagrid>\\n\\n<clr-example [clrCode]=\\\"examples.serverDrivenTS\\\" clrLanguage=\\\"typescript\\\"></clr-example>\\n<clr-example [clrCode]=\\\"examples.serverDrivenHTML\\\" clrLanguage=\\\"html\\\"></clr-example>\\n\"\n\n\n//////////////////\n// WEBPACK FOOTER\n// /Users/mhippely/Projects/clarity-fork/src/demos/datagrid/server-driven/server-driven.html\n// module id = 1306\n// module chunks = 0","module.exports = \"<!--\\n  ~ Copyright (c) 2016 VMware, Inc.

Sometimes, a column\\n    is not even a property on your model but is dynamically generated instead. In these cases,\\n    you might want to specify a custom comparator to sort the column according to your needs.\\n    This can be done by providing a comparator through the\\n    <code class=\\\"clr-code\\\">[clrDgSortBy]</code> input, whether or not your column is declared as a\\n    <code class=\\\"clr-code\\\">clrDgField</code>, and will always take precedence over it if it is.\\n</p>\\n<p>\\n    A comparator is just an object that implements a <code class=\\\"clr-code\\\">compare</code> method\\n    that could be given as parameter to Javascript's native\\n    <code class=\\\"clr-code\\\">Array.sort()</code> function. In other words, if a and b are two\\n    elements being compared, then:\\n</p>\\n<ul>\\n    <li>\\n        if compare(a, b) is less than 0, a comes first,\\n    </li>\\n    <li>\\n        if compare(a, b) returns 0, leave a and b unchanged with respect to each other, but\\n        sorted with respect to all other items,\\n    </li>\\n    <li>\\n        if compare(a, b) is greater than 0, b comes first.\\n    </li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>\\n    The safest way to check that your types comply with our API is to have your comparator be an\\n    instance of a class that implement the <code class=\\\"clr-code\\\">Comparator</code> interface\\n    provided by Clarity.\\n</p>\\n<div class=\\\"alert alert-info\\\">\\n    <div class=\\\"alert-item\\\">\\n        <span class=\\\"alert-text\\\">\\n            Why use an object instead of the function directly?\\n        </span>\\n    </div>\\n    <div class=\\\"alert-item\\\">\\n        <span>\\n            Using an object implementing an interface allows strong type-checking, which is safer\\n            for your application.

Done? Then you\\n    might be a bit overwhelmed by the complexity of custom filters, understandably.\\n    What if you want <em>just a bit more</em> than default string value filters, but phenomenal\\n    cosmic filter power turns out to be slightly overkill? This is where our built-in custom\\n    filters come handy. They let you customize specific parts of the filter like the\\n    string matching function, without having to rewrite the whole thing yourself from two-way\\n    binding inputs to integration in the datagrid.\\n</p>\\n\\n<h4>String filter</h4>\\n\\n<p>\\n    At the moment, the only built-in filter we provide is the \\\"string\\\" filter one, meaning the\\n    user is offered a text input, and the rows will be filtered based on a string-matching\\n    function you provide.

These alerts are for notifying users that a particular component or area of the screen needs attention. Standard alerts have four levels, denoted by color and icon. From most to least severe, they are:</p>\\n\\n    <ul class=\\\"list\\\">\\n        <li>Error–a problem needs fixing</li>\\n        <li>Warning–an action might have a harmful outcome</li>\\n        <li>Info–a situation needs attention, at some point</li>\\n        <li>Success–a significant achievement occurred</li>\\n    </ul>\\n\\n    <p>Other choices for displaying messages are <a routerLink=\\\"/documentation/input-fields\\\">input field validations</a> and <a routerLink=\\\"/documentation/modals\\\">modals</a> . However, these components require users to take action before proceeding.</p>\\n\\n    <h3 id=\\\"placement-and-size\\\">Placement and Size</h3>\\n\\n    <p>Alert positioning should be contextual to the component or area to which it applies. For example, if the alert applies to the entire content area, place it at the top and span the width of that area.</p>\\n\\n    <p>Base the height of the alert (36 or 24 pixels) on its location. The larger alert is for use in the application’s main content area, modals, and wizards. The smaller alert is for use in cards.</p>\\n\\n    <h3 id=\\\"closing-alerts\\\">Closing Alerts</h3>\\n\\n    <p>A close button (X) serves as a method for users to acknowledge the alert. It also allows users to declutter the view. Omit the close button if the alert should be persistent.</p>\\n\\n    <h3 id=\\\"message-text\\\">Message Text</h3>\\n\\n    <p>Keep the message text short and concise. If combining multiple messages in a single alert, make sure that the messages are of the same type. Avoid mixing error and warning messages.</p>\\n\\n    <h3 id=\\\"stacking-alerts\\\">Stacking Alerts</h3>\\n\\n    <p>When showing multiple alerts, stack from most severe to least severe:</p>\\n\\n    <ol class=\\\"list\\\">\\n        <li>Error</li>\\n        <li>Warning</li>\\n        <li>Info</li>\\n        <li>Success</li>\\n    </ol>\\n\\n    <p>Stack up to three alerts. For more than three, consider an alternate pattern, such as displaying the information on another page.</p>\\n\\n    <h3 id=\\\"actions\\\">Actions</h3>\\n\\n    <p>You can display up to two actions in an alert. For more than two actions, use a dropdown menu, limiting the number of items to five.</p>\\n\\n    <p>The most common course of action goes at the top of the menu, destructive actions at the bottom. Avoid placing destructive actions directly in the alert.</p>\\n\\n    <p>Actions in standard alerts are represented by links because links take up less space than buttons and are light in appearance.\\n        <!-- One line is 36 pixels tall using links.

Forms are comprised of <a routerLink=\\\"/documentation/typography\\\">text</a> and input components such as <a routerLink=\\\"/documentation/checkboxes\\\">checkboxes</a>, <a routerLink=\\\"/documentation/dropdowns\\\">dropdowns</a>,\\n        <a routerLink=\\\"/documentation/input-fields\\\">input fields</a>, <a routerLink=\\\"/documentation/radios\\\">radio buttons</a>, and <a routerLink=\\\"/documentation/toggle-switches\\\">toggle switches</a>.</p>\\n\\n    <h4 id=\\\"minimize-scrolling\\\">Minimize Scrolling</h4>\\n\\n    <p>For a form that scrolls several pages, consider organizing the content by:</p>\\n\\n    <ul class=\\\"list\\\">\\n        <li>Grouping related fields in a form block with a descriptive label.</li>\\n        <li>Progressively revealing more complex or less frequently used data.</li>\\n        <li>Dividing content into separate pages in a <a routerLink=\\\"/documentation/wizards\\\">wizard</a>.</li>\\n    </ul>\\n\\n    <h4 id=\\\"labels\\\">Labels</h4>\\n\\n    <p>Labels appear to the left of a component, moving above the component when the user resizes the window to smaller dimensions.</p>\\n\\n    <p>Labels use sentence caps, with no ending punctuation.</p>\\n\\n    <h4 id=\\\"placeholder-text\\\">Placeholder Text</h4>\\n\\n    <p>Located inside a field, placeholder text can help clarify expected input. Placeholder text disappears when the user types in the field.</p>\\n\\n    <p>Tip: Use the label to show what information goes in the field and placeholder text as a hint, description, or example format:</p>\\n\\n    <p>Label: Airport\\n        <br /> Placeholder text: SFO, SJO</p>\\n\\n    <p>Placeholder text can replace labels only in simple forms with a few easily-understood fields, see the <a routerLink=\\\"/documentation/login\\\">login page</a>.</p>\\n\\n    <h4 id=\\\"disabled-fields\\\">Disabled Fields</h4>\\n\\n    <p>Show a disabled field only if the user can take a reasonable action to enable the component. When disabling a component, also disable all associated elements, such as the component label and explanatory text.</p>\\n\\n    <h4 id=\\\"button-placement\\\">Button Placement</h4>\\n\\n    <p>Button placement depends on form type and where it appears in the UI. See <a routerLink=\\\"/documentation/buttons\\\">buttons</a> for guidelines.</p>\\n\\n    <h4 id=\\\"validation\\\">Validation</h4>\\n\\n    <p>For information on validation, see <a routerLink=\\\"/documentation/input-fields\\\">input fields</a>.</p>\\n\\n    <h4 id=\\\"focus-and-navigation\\\">Focus and Navigation</h4>\\n\\n    <p>Provide auto focus in the first field by default.

Some pages might benefit from a three-column layout, where other pages might work best with a two-column layout.</p>\\n\\n    <p>You can vary the column layout within the same page. This strategy works well for presenting content that scrolls vertically.</p>\\n\\n    <p>Don’t lock your design into a layout optimized for a large window.</p>\\n\\n    <h4 id=\\\"grids-and-card-layouts\\\">Grids and Card Layouts</h4>\\n\\n    <p>Designing to a grid is especially important for <a routerLink=\\\"/documentation/cards\\\">card</a> layouts. Cards contains blocks of content and their height and width can vary. The grid aligns the cards in a way that is easy for users to navigate.</p>\\n\\n    <h4 id=\\\"if-you-decide-not-to-conform-to-the-grid\\\">If You Decide Not to Conform to the Grid</h4>\\n\\n    <p>Do so with intent. Find a balance between aesthetics and conformity. Keep in mind that elements that are not aligned to the grid draw attention in the same way as color, contrast, and iconography and require more cognitive effort on the part of the\\n        user.</p>\\n</article>\"\n\n\n//////////////////\n// WEBPACK FOOTER\n// /Users/mhippely/Projects/clarity-fork/src/pages/documentation/grid.html\n// module id = 1439\n// module chunks = 0","module.exports = \"<article>\\n    <h5 class=\\\"component-summary\\\" id=\\\"the-header-and-subnav-support-app-level-information-and-navigation-links\\\">The header and subnav support app-level information and navigation links.</h5>\\n\\n    <h3 id=\\\"header\\\">Header</h3>\\n\\n    <h6 id=\\\"header-1\\\">.header</h6>\\n\\n    <p><code class=\\\"clr-code\\\">.header</code> is a wrapper around the following four sections:</p>\\n\\n    <ul class=\\\"list\\\">\\n        <li>Branding</li>\\n        <li>Navigation</li>\\n        <li>Search</li>\\n        <li>Settings</li>\\n    </ul>\\n\\n    <h6 id=\\\"branding\\\">.branding</h6>\\n\\n    <p><code class=\\\"clr-code\\\">.branding</code> contains the product logo and the product title.

Alternately, include a text label, for example, a cloud icon and the text “Cloud Infrastructure.” You can also provide a tooltip that describes the function of the icon.</p>\\n\\n    <p>Don’t mix standalone icons with standalone text links.</p>\\n\\n    <h4 id=\\\"search-1\\\">Search</h4>\\n\\n    <p>Consider placement of Search as follows:</p>\\n\\n    <ul class=\\\"list\\\">\\n        <li>If the header includes navigation links, place Search to the immediate right of the links.</li>\\n        <li>If the header does not include navigation, make Search the central point.</li>\\n        <li>Otherwise, align Search on the right.</li>\\n    </ul>\\n\\n    <p>For larger screens, include placeholder text in the Search field to give users an example of a search query.</p>\\n\\n    <!--![Search](/clarity/images/documentation/header/Search_header.png)-->\\n\\n    <h4 id=\\\"settings\\\">Settings</h4>\\n\\n    <p>Settings are typically right-aligned. These might include app-related actions such as help and logout. Don’t overcrowd the header with too many settings–consolidate them in a dropdown menu.</p>\\n\\n    <h4 id=\\\"colors\\\">Colors</h4>\\n\\n    <p>Headers have their own color palette. These colors make the header visually recede in focus so it does not compete with the content area.</p>\\n\\n    <p><img src=\\\"assets/images/documentation/header/Colors.png\\\" alt=\\\"Header Colors\\\" /></p>\\n\\n    <h3 id=\\\"using-the-subnav\\\">Using the Subnav</h3>\\n    <p>The subnav is recommended for either app-level navigation links or for links secondary to the ones in the header. For best use of the horizontal space, include five to seven links. Less than five might leave too much empty space.</p>\\n\\n    <p>Use text for the link names, not icons.

For easier access to the individual graphic parts of the icon, each piece of the glyph has a unique number identifier. For example,\\n        <code class=\\\"clr-code\\\">.clr-i-outline-path-3</code> targets the third path in the outlined version of an icon.\\n    </p>\\n\\n    <p>\\n        There are also a couple of common CSS classes that can help you target common elements.\\n        <code class=\\\"clr-code\\\">.clr-i-badge</code> targets the round dot in badged icons. Likewise, <code class=\\\"clr-code\\\">.clr-i-alert</code> targets the yellow triangle in alerted icons.

The icon can then be retrieved like in your application like any other icon in the ClarityIcons library.\\n    </p>\\n    <pre><code clr-code-highlight=\\\"language-typescript\\\">\\n&lt;clr-icon shape=&quot;shapeNameGoesHere&quot;&gt;&lt;/clr-icon&gt;\\n</code></pre>\\n\\n    <h5>Creating custom aliases for ClarityIcons</h5>\\n    <p>\\n        The Clarity Icons API can create aliases for the icons in your application with a single API call:\\n    </p>\\n    <pre><code clr-code-highlight=\\\"language-typescript\\\">\\nClarityIcons.alias({{'{'}}\\\"bell\\\": [\\\"alarm\\\", \\\"oh-noehz\\\"]{{'}'}});\\n</code></pre>\\n    <p>\\n        The above method call will assign \\\"alarm\\\" and \\\"oh-noehz\\\" names to the existing \\\"bell\\\" icon shape. Now you can use the \\\"bell\\\" icon with any of the new names you have assigned it.\\n    </p>\\n    <pre><code clr-code-highlight=\\\"language-html\\\">\\n&lt;clr-icon shape=&quot;bell&quot;&gt;&lt;/clr-icon&gt;\\n&lt;clr-icon shape=&quot;alarm&quot;&gt;&lt;/clr-icon&gt;\\n&lt;clr-icon shape=&quot;oh-noehz&quot;&gt;&lt;/clr-icon&gt;\\n</code></pre>\\n\\n</article>\"\n\n\n//////////////////\n// WEBPACK FOOTER\n// /Users/mhippely/Projects/clarity-fork/src/pages/documentation/iconography.html\n// module id = 1441\n// module chunks = 0","module.exports = \"<article>\\n    <h5 class=\\\"component-summary\\\" id=\\\"clarity-has-a-single-line-input-field-and-a-multiline-text-area\\\">Clarity has a single-line input field and a multiline text area.</h5>\\n\\n    <p>Input fields are composed of a label followed by an <code class=\\\"clr-code\\\">input</code> or <code class=\\\"clr-code\\\">textarea</code> wrapped in a block element with the <code class=\\\"clr-code\\\">.form-group</code> classname applied to it.</p>\\n\\n    <clr-input-fields-demo></clr-input-fields-demo>\\n\\n    <h4 id=\\\"form-validation\\\">Form Validation</h4>\\n\\n    <p>You can use validation styling for input fields by wrapping the input tag in a container with the <code class=\\\"clr-code\\\">.tooltip</code> class along with the <code class=\\\"clr-code\\\">.tooltip-validation</code> class.

Common editing controls include\\n        input fields, select boxes, checkboxes, and radio buttons.</p>\\n\\n    <h4 id=\\\"labels\\\">Labels</h4>\\n\\n    <ul class=\\\"list\\\">\\n        <li>Provide terse labels that let users know what is under the label.

The component exposes two methods (<code class=\\\"clr-code\\\">skipTab</code> and\\n        <code class=\\\"clr-code\\\">unSkipTab</code>) to skip or un-skip a step. In order to use the methods, you will have to specify a unique id as an input (\\n        <code class=\\\"clr-code\\\">clrWizardStepId</code>) and pass that value into the methods. You can also set the input <code class=\\\"clr-code\\\">clrWizardStepIsSkipped</code> and the corresponding <code class=\\\"clr-code\\\">clrWizardPageIsSkipped</code> to\\n        skip the step and the matching page as shown in the example below.</p>\\n\\n    <h4 id=\\\"overriding-the-title-in-the-wizard-page\\\">Overriding the Title in the Wizard Page</h4>\\n\\n    <p>By default, the page on the right-hand side will display the same title as the text that is inside the <code class=\\\"clr-code\\\">&lt;clr-wizard-step&gt;</code>. You may wish to override this for the matching page. You can do this by including an element\\n        inside the\\n        <code class=\\\"clr-code\\\">&lt;clr-wizard-page&gt;</code> with class <code class=\\\"clr-code\\\">.wizard-page-title</code> as shown in the example below.</p>\\n\\n    <clr-wizard-simple></clr-wizard-simple>\\n\\n    <h3 id=\\\"wizard-with-form-validation\\\">Wizard with Form Validation</h3>\\n\\n    <p>You can use form validation with the wizard.

A wizard simplifies the workflow by directing users serially through the tasks.</p>\\n\\n    <p>If the user doesn’t need to complete the workflow in a predefined order, use a <a routerLink=\\\"/documentation/modals\\\">modal</a> instead.</p>\\n\\n    <h4 id=\\\"base-wizard-size-on-use-case\\\">Base Wizard size on use case</h4>\\n\\n    <p>BSizes are 576 px, 864 px and 1056 px (default). The best design provides a good balance between white space and the number of elements per page. Overloading a page with too many controls can be a problem as can having many sparsely-populated pages.</p>\\n\\n    <h4 id=\\\"title\\\">Title</h4>\\n\\n    <p>Typically task-based, the title should summarize the workflow, for example, Create Hardware Profile.</p>\\n\\n    <h4 id=\\\"steps\\\">Steps</h4>\\n    <div class=\\\"row buttons-modal-gfx\\\">\\n        <div class=\\\"col-md-6 col-sm-12 flex-xs-middle\\\">\\n            <img src=\\\"assets/images/documentation/wizards/New_wizard.png\\\" alt=\\\"Buttons on inner wizard pages\\\" style=\\\"max-width:100%;\\\" />\\n        </div>\\n\\n        <div class=\\\"col-md-5 offset-md-1 col-sm-12 clrweb-wizardsteps-block\\\">\\n            <h4>Streamline the number of steps</h4>\\n            <p>\\n                A wizard should be at least two steps. Otherwise, a modal will suffice. Also, avoid vertical scrolling of steps. At the default size, the steps scroll at 14 lines.\\n            </p>\\n\\n            <h4>Non-branching wizards are preferable</h4>\\n            <p>\\n                However, if a user choice results in a change in the number of steps, make the change early in the workflow. Otherwise, users might lose track of the navigation path.\\n            </p>\\n\\n            <h4>Steps titles should be concise and direct</h4>\\n            <p>\\n                To help readers scan the text, use sentence-style caps and no ending punctuation. Avoid text that is so long it wraps to the next line.\\n            </p>\\n        </div>\\n    </div>\\n\\n    <h4 id=\\\"pages\\\">Pages</h4>\\n\\n    <h6 id=\\\"use-the-header-to-set-context\\\">Use the header to set context</h6>\\n\\n    <p>By default, the page header is the same text as the selected step. If needed, enhance the header text to clarify meaning.</p>\\n\\n    <h6 id=\\\"ensure-content-is-cohesive\\\">Ensure content is cohesive</h6>\\n\\n    <p>All text and components should support the goal or purpose of the page.</p>\\n\\n    <p>Avoid:</p>\\n\\n    <ul class=\\\"list\\\">\\n        <li>Putting more than one task on a page. Pages are easier to use when they present a single step of the workflow.</li>\\n        <li>Opening a modal or wizard from within a wizard. This increases the complexity of the workflow.</li>\\n        <li>Putting so much content on a page that it scrolls.</li>\\n    </ul>\\n\\n    <h6 id=\\\"buttons-are-right-aligned-in-the-footer\\\">Buttons are right-aligned, in the footer</h6>\\n\\n    <p>Right alignment supports the Z-pattern layout.

The Close button is in the upper right corner as a visual affordance and for accessibility reasons.</p>\\n\\n    <p>Clicking outside the wizard should not dismiss it. Users might accidentally click outside the wizard and lose data.</p>\\n\\n    <h6 id=\\\"scrolling\\\">Scrolling</h6>\\n\\n    <p>Some wizard pages might require scrolling. The title and buttons remain in place when the content scrolls.</p>\\n\\n    <p>Clarity does not use horizontal lines to define the scrollable area. This keeps the UI clean and simple. Also, a line above the buttons makes it appear as if all content is visible.</p>\\n\\n    <h6 id=\\\"validation\\\">Validation</h6>\\n\\n    <p>Validation of user input can occur at the field level, the page level, and when the user finishes the wizard. This control allows users to complete actions with minimal risk of error or data loss.</p>\\n\\n    <p>For more information on validation, see <a routerLink=\\\"/documentation/input-fields\\\">input fields</a>.</p>\\n</article>\\n\"\n\n\n//////////////////\n// WEBPACK FOOTER\n// /Users/mhippely/Projects/clarity-fork/src/pages/documentation/wizards.html\n// module id = 1459\n// module chunks = 0"],"sourceRoot":""}
