# Contributor Code of Conduct

As contributors and maintainers of the Clarity project, we pledge to respect everyone who contributes by posting issues, updating documentation, submitting pull requests, providing feedback in comments, and any other activities.

Communication through any of Clarity's channels (GitHub, mailing lists, Twitter, and so on) must be constructive and never resort to personal attacks, trolling, public or private harassment, insults, or other unprofessional conduct.

We promise to extend courtesy and respect to everyone involved in this project, regardless of gender, gender identity, sexual orientation, disability, age, race, ethnicity, religion, or level of experience. We expect anyone contributing to the Clarity project to do the same.

If any member of the community violates this code of conduct, the maintainers of the Clarity project may take action, including removing issues, comments, and PRs or blocking accounts, as deemed appropriate.

If you are subjected to or witness unacceptable behavior, or have any other concerns, please communicate with us.

If you have suggestions to improve this Code of Conduct, please submit an issue or PR.
