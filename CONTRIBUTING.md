# Contributing to Clarity
The Clarity project team welcomes contributions from the community. Together, we can grow Clarity and make it a better framework.

Before you contribute in any way to Clarity, please make sure to read our [code of conduct](/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).


## Types of contribution
Because Clarity provides everything from the abstract patterns of a design system to the nitty-gritty implementation of
accessibility for Angular components, contributions to Clarity can take many forms, and each of them will correspond
to part of the full process. Generally speaking, contributions fit into one or more of these categories:

- New design or update to an existing one: general patterns, components, features, ... See
[Contributing to Design](#contributing-to-design).
- Implementation of an existing design and bug fixes (which might involve a design). See
[Contributing to Development](#contributing-to-development).
- Documentation. See [Contributing to Documentation](#contributing-to-documentation).

Many contributions can fall into more than one of these categories at once but it's important to split the contribution
along these steps, to make sure each of them is solid before moving on to the next. 
For instance, if you want to contribute a brand new Angular component to Clarity you'll first need to go through a 
design submission step, then you can move to the development contribution process once the design has been finalized, 
and finally you can add the corresponding documentation to the website 
(that step is strongly recommended but optional, we know how it is...).


## Contributing to Design
[TODO with Red]

- Explain the use case
- Provide designs for the usual case
- Provide error states
- Edge cases
- i18n/long text visuals
- Example with scrollbars for Windows devices
- Accessibility recommendation (tab order, keyboard navigation, ...)
- Describe motion if needed or provide a GIF for it


## Contributing to Development

Barring exceptionally small contributions like one-line bug fixes, please follow the process described in 
[DEVELOPMENT_CONTRIBUTION.md](/DEVELOPMENT_CONTRIBUTION.md).


## Contributing to Documentation

The [Clarity documentation website](https://vmware.github.io/clarity) is also in this repository in the `website` 
branch.  You can contribute to the documentation by submitting pull requests against that branch. Details about how to
setup and run the website locally can be found on the wiki at 
https://github.com/vmware/clarity/wiki/Building-the-Website.
Please note that for larger contributions to the website, you will need to follow the 
[development contribution process](/DEVELOPMENT_CONTRIBUTION.md) too.
