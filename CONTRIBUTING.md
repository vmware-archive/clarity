# Contributing to Clarity
The Clarity project team welcomes contributions from the community.   Together, we can grow Clarity and make it a better framework.

## Contribution Guidelines

Before you start working with Clarity, please complete the following steps:

- Read our [code of conduct](/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
- Read our [Developer Certificate of Origin](https://cla.vmware.com/dco). All contributions to this repository must be signed as described on that page. Your signature certifies that you wrote the patch or have the right to pass it on as an open-source patch.
- Read our [coding guidelines](/CODING_GUIDELINES.md).

## Contribution Flow

Here are the typical steps in a contributor's workflow:

- [Fork](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) the main Clarity repository.
- Clone your fork and set the upstream remote to the main Clarity repository.
- Set your name and e-mail in the Git configuration for signing.
- Create a topic branch from where you want to base your work.
- Setup your local environment to run and build Clarity. See our [build documentation](BUILD.md).
- Make commits of logical units.
- Make sure `npm test` passes for each of them.
- Make sure `npm clang` passes for each of them. If not, you can run a gulp task (clang:format) to format your code.
- Make sure `npm tslint` passes for each of them. If not, you can run a gulp task (tslint:fix) to try to auto-fix some of them.
For certain lint failures you will have to fix them manually.
- Make sure your commit messages are in the proper format (see below).
- Push your changes to a topic branch in your fork of the repository.
- [Submit a pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/).

Example:

``` shell
# Clone your forked repository
git clone git@github.com:<github username>/clarity.git

# Navigate to the directory
cd clarity

# Set name and e-mail configuration
git config user.name "John Doe"
git config user.email johndoe@example.com

# Setup the upstream remote
git remote add upstream https://github.com/vmware/clarity.git

# Create a topic branch for your changes
git checkout -b my-new-feature master

# After making the desired changes, test, commit and push to your fork
npm test
git commit -a -s
git push origin my-new-feature
```

### Staying In Sync With Upstream

When your branch gets out of sync with the master branch, use the following to update:

``` shell
git checkout my-new-feature
git fetch -a
git pull --rebase upstream master
git push --force-with-lease origin my-new-feature
```

### Updating Pull Requests

If your PR fails to pass CI, or requires changes based on code review, you'll most likely want to squash these changes into existing commits.

If your pull request contains a single commit, or your changes are related to the most recent commit, you can amend the commit.

``` shell
git add .
git commit --amend
git push --force-with-lease origin my-new-feature
```

If you need to squash changes into an earlier commit, use the following:

``` shell
git add .
git commit --fixup <commit>
git rebase -i --autosquash master
git push --force-with-lease origin my-new-feature
```

Make sure you add a comment to the PR indicating that your changes are ready to review. GitHub does not generate a notification when you use git push.

### Formatting Commit Messages

Use this format for your commit message:

```
[<type>] <title>
<BLANK LINE>
<detailed commit message>
<BLANK LINE>
<reference to closing an issue>
<BLANK LINE>
Signed-off-by: Your Name <your.email@example.com>
```

#### Type

Type must be one of the following:

* `UX`: Research and design principles. These are typically documentation commits.
* `ICON`: Implementation of Clarity's Custom Element icons.
* `UI`: Implementation of Clarity's static styles, its general look-and-feel.
* `NG`: Implementation of Clarity's Angular components.
* `CORE`: Website, distribution, build script and tooling.
