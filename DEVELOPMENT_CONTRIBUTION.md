# Contribution process for developers
If you plan on contributing code to Clarity, please follow this step-by-step process in order to reduce the risk of major changes being requested when you submit your pull request. We'll work with you on every step and try to be as responsive as possible.

## I. Proposal template

Before you start coding anything, please fill out the following proposal template in as much detail as you can. The more complete your details the better, but not all questions will apply for every change.
As you fill this out, please make sure to follow [our guidelines](/CODING_GUIDELINES.md#public-api) for the public API of components.
```markdown
## Summary

Describe the change or feature in detail. Try to answer the following questions.

* What is the change?
* What is a use case for this change?
* Why should it go in Clarity?
* Does this change impact existing behaviors? If so how?
* If this change introduces a new behavior, is this behavior accessible?


## Examples

_If possible, show examples of the change. You may create one yourself, or link to external sites that have the idea. It can also be very useful to prototype the idea in isolation outside of Clarity with a Plunkr or Stackblitz example._


## API

_Describe the intended API for the feature you want to add. This would include:_

* CSS classes and DOM structure for pure static UI contribution, and inputs/outputs, components, directives, services, or anything that is exported publicly for Angular contributions.
* Examples of code snippets using this new feature.
* Note very clearly if anything **might** be a breaking change.

_In the case of bug fixes or internal changes, there will most likely be no API changes._


## Implementation Plan

_Describe how you plan to implement the feature, answering questions among the following or anything else you deem relevant._

* What parts of the code are affected?
* Will you introduce new services, components or directives?
* Can you describe the basic flow of information between classes?
* Does this introduce asynchronous behaviors?
* Will you need to refactor existing Clarity code?
* Will reasonable performance require optimizations?
* Will it need to access native elements (and be incompatible with server-side rendering)?
* ...


## Conclusion

_Describe how long you expect it to take to implement, what help you might need, and any other details that might be helpful. Don't worry, this is obviously non-contractual. ðŸ˜›_
```

Once it's ready, post it either on the original GitHub issue for bug fixes or already designed components, or in a new issue otherwise. If the original issue hasn't been updated in a while, please ping @youdz, @gnomeontherun or @adityarb88 on the issue to ensure we will start the discussion as soon as possible.

We will discuss the proposal with you publicly on the issue, potentially requesting changes, and hopefully accept it.


## II. Implementation on a topic branch

### Prerequisites
Make sure you first:
- Read our [Developer Certificate of Origin](https://cla.vmware.com/dco). All contributions to this repository must be signed as described on that page. Your signature certifies that you wrote the patch or have the right to pass it on as an open-source patch.
- Read our [coding guidelines](/CODING_GUIDELINES.md).

### Getting started

When we post on the issue to approve your proposal, the person on the team who'll be your primary contact will post a link to a topic branch against which you will submit your pull requests. The topic branch will be branched from the latest `master` and named `topic/{feature-name}`. To merge any pull request into this branch it will need 2 ship its from team members.

Start by [forking](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) the main Clarity repository, and follow the instructions in the previous link to clone your fork and set the upstream remote to the main Clarity repository. Because of the DCO, set your name and e-mail in the Git configuration for signing. Finally, create a local topic branch from the upstream `topic/{feature-name}` mentioned above.

For instance, this setup part could look like this:
```shell
## Clone your forked repository
git clone git@github.com:<github username>/clarity.git

## Navigate to the directory
cd clarity

## Set name and e-mail configuration
git config user.name "John Doe"
git config user.email johndoe@example.com

## Setup the upstream remote
git remote add upstream https://github.com/vmware/clarity.git

## Check out the upstream a topic branch for your changes
git fetch
git checkout -b topic/feature-name upstream/topic/feature-name
```

### Commits

Open-source for web UI still feels like the Wild West, so we're trying to take a page from older open-source projects, even if... _Javascript_ ðŸ™„.  In particular, if your contribution is large, split it into smaller commits that are logically self-contained. You can then submit them as separate pull requests that we will review one by one and merge progressively into the topic branch. As a rule of thumb, try to keep each pull request under a couple hundred lines of code, _unit tests included_. We realize this isn't always easy, and sometimes not possible at all, so feel free to ask how to split your contribution in the GitHub issue. In general, it's a good idea to start coding the services first and test them in isolation, then move to the components.

For your commit message, please use the following format:
```
[<type>] <title>
<BLANK LINE>
<detailed commit message>
<BLANK LINE>
<reference to closing an issue>
<BLANK LINE>
Signed-off-by: Your Name <your.email@example.com>
```

Type must be one of the following:

- `UX`: Research and design principles. These are typically documentation commits.
- `ICON`: Implementation of Clarity's Custom Element icons.
- `UI`: Implementation of Clarity's static styles, its general look-and-feel.
- `NG`: Implementation of Clarity's Angular components.
- `WEB`: Website and documentation updates.
- `CORE`: Distribution, build script and tooling.
- `SCHEMATICS`: Implementation of schematics for Angular CLI.

These documents provide guidance creating a well-crafted commit message:

- [How to Write a Git Commit Message](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)
- [Closing Issues Via Commit Messages](https://help.github.com/articles/closing-issues-via-commit-messages/)


### Submitting pull requests 

As you implement your contribution, make sure all work stays on your local topic branch. When an isolated part of the feature is complete with unit tests, make sure to submit your pull request **against the topic branch** on the main Clarity repository instead of `master`. This will allow us to accept and merge partial changes that shouldn't make it into a production release of Clarity yet. We expect every pull request to come with exhaustive unit tests for the submitted code.

**Do not, at any point, rebase your local topic branch on newer versions of `master` while your work is still in progress!** This will create issues both for you, the reviewers, and maybe even other developers who might submit additional commits to your topic branch if you requested some help.

To make sure your pull request will pass our automated testing, before submitting you should:

- Make sure `npm test` passes for each of them.
- Make sure `npm run clang:check` passes for each of them. If not, you can run `npm run clang:format` to format your code.
- Make sure `npm run tslint:check` passes for each of them. If not, you can run `npm run tslint:fix` to try to auto-fix some of them.
For certain lint failures you will have to fix them manually.

If everything passes, you can push your changes to your fork of Clarity, and [submit a pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/). Remember, submit it **against the topic branch** on the main Clarity repository, not `master`!

### Taking reviews into account

During the review process of your pull request(s), some changes might be requested by Clarity team members. If that happens, add extra commits to your pull request to address these changes. Make sure these new commits are also signed and follow our commit message format.

**Do not amend your commits or squash them**, it will only slow down the review process by forcing reviewers to check every line again. We'll clean up the commit history ourselves when we finally merge your pull request, you don't have to worry about it.

### Shipping it

Once your contribution is fully implemented, reviewed and ready, we will rebase the topic branch on the newest `master` and squash down to fewer commits if needed (keeping you as the author, obviously). Chances are we will be more familiar with potential conflicts that might happen, but we can work with you if you want to solve some conflicts yourself. Once rebased we will merge the topic branch into `master`, which involves a quick internal pull request you don't have to worry about, and we will finally delete the topic branch.

At that point, your contribution will be available in the next official release of Clarity.
