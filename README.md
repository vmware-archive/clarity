NOTE: The Clarity Design System has moved and is now split into two repositories, one for [Clarity Angular](https://github.com/vmware-clarity/ng-clarity) and one for [Clarity Core](https://github.com/vmware-clarity/core). This repository is now for archived purposes only.

# Clarity Design System

guidelines, design resources, and coding implementations with Web Components. This

Clarity. For complete documentation, visit the [Clarity website](https://clarity.design).
