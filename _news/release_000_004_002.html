<h2>Highlights</h2>

    <li>
        <h6>Implement alternative for outline:none</h6>

              <span class="alert-text">
                  While this is not a breaking change, product teams that do not
                  want accessible outlines in their applications should review
                  any impact this change had to determine if they want to override
                  the outline style on their own.
              </span>

        <p style="margin-top: 12px">
            The Clarity team implemented accessible outline highlighting for keyboard
            navigation. Previously, Clarity UI had overridden the default. There may be an
            impact for applications that had relied on the default override. In those
            cases, developers should implement their own override. The Clarity team
            removed the override because it hindered accessibility.

    <li>
        <h6>Update visited links color</h6>
        <p>
            The visited link text color has been changed. Just a heads up that there's
            a slightly different shade of purple in use. Those who were already
            overriding the visited link text color should not be impacted.
