        <h6>Upgrade Clarity Seed to Angular 2.0.0</h6>
        <h6>Upgrade Clarity to Angular 2.0.0</h6>
        <p style="margin-top: 24px">
            Clarity 0.5.0 is in Angular 2.0.0 Final!
        </p>
        <p>
            Here are the recommended version numbers you could use in your package.json:
        </p>
<pre>
    <code class="language-js">
    "dependencies": {
        "@angular/common": "2.0.0",
        "@angular/compiler": "2.0.0",
        "@angular/core": "2.0.0",
        "@angular/forms": "2.0.0",
        "@angular/http": "2.0.0",
        "@angular/platform-browser": "2.0.0",
        "@angular/platform-browser-dynamic": "2.0.0",
        "@angular/router": "3.0.0",
        "@angular/upgrade": "2.0.0",
        ...
    }
</code></pre>
        <p>
            Declaring directives and pipes in components has been deprecated. That
            means you will no longer import Clarity directives in the components as
            you have done with previous versions like this:
        </p>
<pre>
    <code class="language-js">
    import {SOME_CLARITY_DIRECTIVE} from "clarity-angular";
    @Component({
        ...
        directives: [SOME_CLARITY_DIRECTIVE],
        ...
    });

    export class YourComponent {        }
</code></pre>

    <p>
        Instead, now an application that consumes Clarity should at least have
        one app-level module like below:
    </p>

<pre>
    <code class="language-js">
    import { NgModule } from '@angular/core';
    import { BrowserModule } from '@angular/platform-browser';
    import { ClarityModule } from 'clarity-angular';
    import { AppComponent } from './app.component';

    @NgModule({
        imports: [
            BrowserModule,
            ClarityModule,
            ....(other modules from Angular or 3rd parties for your app)
        ],
        declarations: [ AppComponent ],
        bootstrap: [ AppComponent ]
    })

    export class AppModule {
    }
</code></pre>

        <p>
            Your dependencies (components, directives, pipes, services, etc)
            should be declared and exported through modules.
