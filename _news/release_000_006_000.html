<h2>Highlights</h2>
<ul class="list-unstyled whats-new-highlights">
    <li>
        <h6>Move Clarity to the Metropolis font</h6>
        <p>
            To prepare for the future of Clarity's beta and beyond, Clarity has
            adopted the new OFL-licensed typeface, Metropolis. <a

<h2>Breaking Changes</h2>
<ul class="list-unstyled whats-new-highlights">
    <li>
        <h6>Upgrade BS4 to Alpha 5</h6>
        <p>
            Clarity has been upgraded to the latest alpha version of Bootstrap
            4: Bootstrap 4, alpha 5. In its latest alpha release, the Bootstrap
            team has changed a number of utility classes — like
            <code class="clr-code">float-*-left</code> instead of
            <code class="clr-code">pull-*-left</code>. In some cases, this may
            constitute a breaking change for applications that were dependent
            on the old utility classnames. <a

    <li>
        <h6>Move Clarity to the Metropolis font</h6>
        <p>
            As a precaution, make sure to check out your application after
            upgrading to ClarityUI 0.6.0 to make sure the change to the
            Metropolis font hasn’t had a negative impact on your application.
            Metropolis is very close to the previous font that Clarity was
            using but it is a different font. The Clarity team have not
            encountered any negative side effects with the font change but want
            to promote awareness around it.
