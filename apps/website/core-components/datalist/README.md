## Usage

:::

:::component-section-level-one

Use a datalist when the user needs to choose from a list of items that is long enough for it to be filtered it before selection. Or, there are pre-defined options but the user needs the ability to input a custom value for their use case.

Use a datalist of you want to provide a standard set of options but also allow the user to enter a custom value that may not be pre-defined.

Do not confuse a datalist element with the select input. Datalist elements usually have more than 13 options that the user will need to filter or narrow down before making a choice. If there are 3-13 options, consider using the [select](../select/) input.
