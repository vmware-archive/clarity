To use the divider component import the component in your JavaScript.

```javascript
import '@cds/core/divider/register.js';
```

:::

Clarity recommends using dividers inside of containers with a `cds-layout` attribute. This allows dividers to span the full dimensions of the container as expected.

<CdsDemos componentName="divider" />
