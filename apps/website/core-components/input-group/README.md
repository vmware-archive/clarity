Use an input group when the user needs to submit complex information comprised of separate components such as a location consisting of a prefix such as: ftp / http / https, a domain, and a suffix. An input group provides a way for the user to supply these connceted pieces of information while treating them as one.

Input groups may use any textual input controls including input, select, datalist, and date picker.
