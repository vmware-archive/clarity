Clarity Core components can be easily updated using NPM or Yarn.

```bash
npm install @cds/core@latest # installs the latest release
```

If you are using either the React or Angular packages, you should update them at the same time.

```bash
npm install @cds/core@latest @cds/angular@latest # updates both Core and Angular
npm install @cds/core@latest @cds/react@latest # updates both Core and React
```

If there is a prerelease version available for testing, you can install it using the `next` tag on NPM. These versions are only available when we are actively working on a new major version, so only do this if you are willing to try beta software.

```bash
npm install @cds/core@next
```
