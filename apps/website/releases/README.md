# Release Policies

Clarity releases regular updates to our library with new features, bugfixes, and other important changes.

## Release Cycle

Clarity typically releases every two weeks, though we may release more or less frequently as needed. Each release's changelog is documented in the releases section for that version.

You can see the [support policies](../get-started/support/#support-policy) for each release to see how long to expect it to recieve active support.
