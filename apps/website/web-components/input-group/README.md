### Control actions - buttons & icons

:::

:::component-section-level-two

Use `cds-control-action` to place a button that facilitates the user in completing the data input process. Common problems this solves for users is clearing an input or opening a dialog that will offer them a choice to populate the input control. Or, for password fields offering both a clear and a hide/show button helps the user complete the input accurately.
