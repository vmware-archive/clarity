Modals inform users about a task and can contain decisive information that requires immediate attention.

## Usage

:::

:::component-section-level-one

Use a modal when required to interrupt the user to address a specific critical task that needs immediate resolution.

When to use a modal:

<ul cds-list cds-text="body" cds-layout="p-t:md p-b:lg">
    <li>To grab userâ€™s attention for <b>an important message</b>.</li>
    <li>To show <b>additional information</b> without losing the context of the parent page.</li>
    <li>To break down <b>a complex workflow</b> into a series of less complicated steps.</li>
</ul>

When not to use a modal:

<ul cds-list cds-text="body" cds-layout="p-t:md">
    <li>For <b>nonessential information</b> that is not related to the current workflow.</li>
    <li>For complex workflows that require additional information <b>not contained within the modal</b>.</li>
    <li><b>Avoid modal over modal</b>. Context becomes confusing when modals are stacked.</li>
</ul>

### Dismissing modals

:::

:::component-section-level-two

<div cds-layout="horizontal gap:lg align:fill">
<div cds-layout="vertical">
<p>A user needs to actively dismiss a modal. A modal should not disappear on its own. Taking any of the actions to either cancel or proceed should eventually dismiss the modal.</p>

<p>There are multiple ways to dismiss a modal but a user needs to intentionally make that choice.</p>

<p>Clarity modals are not dismissed when clicking on the background overlay. This prevents losing information or data. An option to override this is available.</p>

### Stacking modals

:::

<div cds-layout="horizontal gap:lg align:fill p-b:xxl">
<div cds-layout="vertical gap:md">
<p>Modals should not launch other modals. Stacking modals makes it hard to dismiss them and confuses the user on their levels of importance.</p>
<p>If you see a need to stack modals, you should:</p>
<ul cds-list cds-text="body">
<li>Seek alternatives to the second modal such as inline expansion within the first one.</li>
<li>Seek alternatives to the use of modals in that scenario and explore alternatives such as inline task completion.</li>
</ul>
</div>
