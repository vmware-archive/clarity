# Core Web Component Coding guidelines

To ensure the highest quality and maintainability for Clarity Web Components, we
adhere to the following guidelines for our Core Web Component codebase.

New components should go through our standard [Development Contribution Guidelines](./../DEVELOPMENT_CONTRIBUTION.md).
Components with an accepted proposal and API design will need to follow the
code conventions, as described in this outline. New components will need to have
a new Storybook Story for the full API and any additional common use
cases as additional stories.
