# Reporting Bugs and Creating Issues

You can submit an issue or a bug to our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/vmware/clarity/issues). You must provide:

- The link to the reproduction scenario you created using one of the
  [Clarity StackBlitz Templates](https://stackblitz.com/@clr-team)
- The version number of Angular if using Angular
- The version number of Clarity
- The browser name and version number
- Screenshot is also a good way to show us what is the issue

When providing the NPM package version, make sure to check them from the `package-lock.json` file.
This is extremely important in the cases that NPM [versioning tags](https://devhints.io/semver) are applied.
