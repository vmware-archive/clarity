# Reporting Bugs and Creating Issues

You can submit an issue or a bug to our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/vmware/clarity/issues). You must provide:

- The link to the reproduction scenario you created using one of the
  [Clarity StackBlitz Templates](https://stackblitz.com/@clr-team)
- The version number of your web application framework(s)
- The version number of Clarity
- The browser name and version number
- Screenshot is also a good way to show us what is the issue, but reproductions are best

When you are looking for your Clarity version, run `npm ls @cds/core` or `npm ls @clr/angular` to get the
exact currently installed version, since the package.json file might allow a range of versions to be installed.
