        <h2 id="forms-code-samples">Forms with CSS</h2>

        <p>If you want to use just the HTML/CSS for building your own form controls, this section describes how to use them. If you are interested in how to use it with Angular, please jump to the Angular section.</p>

        <h4>Basic form</h4>

        <p>A Clarity form first must include the <code class="clr-code">.clr-form</code> class, typically on the form element itself.</p>

        <clr-code-snippet [clrCode]="uiForm"></clr-code-snippet>
        
        <h4>Layout options</h4>

        <p>Forms support three layout options, vertical (default), horizontal, and compact. You can change the layout by simply applying an additional class to the form.</p>
        
        <clr-code-snippet [clrCode]="uiLayouts"></clr-code-snippet>
        
        <h4>Basic structure</h4>

        <p>Each control that you add inside has a similar structure, and they are each covered in their own documentation. However, the general structure is like this for a normal text input.</p>
        
        <clr-code-snippet [clrCode]="uiStructure"></clr-code-snippet>
        
        <h4>Layouts with grid</h4>

        <p>If you choose to use a layout other than vertical, you should also provide the corresponding grid classes to allow the form layout to dynamically switch to vertical for narrow width devices. Excluding this may cause experience issues with mobile or narrow widths.</p>
        
        <clr-code-snippet [clrCode]="uiGrid"></clr-code-snippet>
        
        <h4>Error state</h4>

        <p>For error states, you simply need to add the <code class="clr-code">clr-error</code> class to the <code class="clr-code">clr-control-container</code> element. This will automatically display the error icon, turn the input outline to red, and change the color of the subtext to red. It is recommend that you change the content of the subtext for error messages, but that is up to the application to manage.</p>
        
        <clr-code-snippet [clrCode]="uiGrid"></clr-code-snippet>
        
        <p>View documentation for each form control to get specifics on their HTML structure.</p>
        



        <h2 id="forms-using-angular">Forms Using Angular</h2>
        
        <p>Clarity has created a set of directives to help manage forms with minimal effort by developers. The structure is more condensed and easier to implement, so it is the recommended approach to use the following if you are using Angular. More form controls are being added regularly.</p>

        <div class="alert alert-info">
            <div class="alert-items">
                <div class="alert-item static">
                    <div class="alert-icon-wrapper">
                        <clr-icon class="alert-icon" shape="info-circle"></clr-icon>
                    </div>
                    <span class="alert-text">
                        The forms features described here are not part of the main <code class="clr-code">ClarityModule</code> in this release. You have to opt into them by including the additional <code class="clr-code">ClrFormsNextModule</code> in your module imports.
                    </span>
                </div>
            </div>
        </div>

        <h4>Include <code class="clr-code">ClrFormsNextModule</code></h4>
        
        <p>The new forms are opt-in right now, since they are not fully ready for use yet. In order to use it, begin by importing the <code class="clr-code">ClrFormsNextModule</code> and adding it to your module imports.</p>
        
        <clr-code-snippet [clrCode]="ngModule" clrLanguage="typescript"></clr-code-snippet>

        <h4>Basic form</h4>

        <p>Then declare a form start by adding the <code class="clr-code">clrForm</code> directive to the form element. This will wire up some internals to manage the form itself.</p>
        
        <clr-code-snippet [clrCode]="ngForm"></clr-code-snippet>
        
        <h4>Layout options</h4>

        <p>If you wish to have a different layout, then you can use the <code class="clr-code">clrLayout</code> directive to set the desired layout. The appropriate grid classes will be applied to enable automatic layout switching for mobile viewports.</p>
        
        <clr-code-snippet [clrCode]="ngLayouts"></clr-code-snippet>
        
        <h4>Basic structure</h4>

        <p>When you start to fill in your form controls, each will should be wrapped in a container like you see here in this text input example.</p>
        
        <clr-code-snippet [clrCode]="ngStructure"></clr-code-snippet>
        
        <h4>Helper and validation messages</h4>

        <p>These Angular components also support built in helper text and validation with error messages. </p>
        
        <clr-code-snippet [clrCode]="ngHelpers"></clr-code-snippet>
        
        <h4>Multiple error messages</h4>

        <p>If you want to support multiple error messages, you can do this by defining an error message for each scenario using <code class="clr-code">clrIfError</code>. It is recommended that you create an error message for each validatior you specify. Use the validator name provided in the binding for <code class="clr-code">*clrIfError="'errorName'"</code>, which might be your custom validator or a built in Angular one.</p>
        
        <clr-code-snippet [clrCode]="ngErrors"></clr-code-snippet>
        
        <h4>Reactive Forms</h4>

        <p>Forms also work with reactive forms with the same support for validations.</p>
        
        <clr-code-snippet [clrCode]="ngReactiveTs" clrLanguage="typescript"></clr-code-snippet>
        <clr-code-snippet [clrCode]="ngReactiveHtml"></clr-code-snippet>
