<h2>Highlights</h2>
<ul class="list-unstyled whats-new-highlights">
    <li>
        <h6 breaking-change>Angular 6 support</h6>
        <p>
            Clarity has updated to run with Angular 6 and Rxjs 6 without the need for the rxjs-compat layer. The 0.12 release is only
            certified to work with Angular 6 and above.
        </p>
        <h6>Support for Angular CLI <code class="clr-code">ng add</code></h6>
        <p>
            Clarity can now be installed using Angular CLI v6+ by simply running the following:
            <code class="clr-code">ng add @clr/angular@next</code>. The
            <code class="clr-code">@next</code> tag is necessary only while Clarity 0.12 is in prerelease, afterwards it won't be necessary. You can use this
            with any Angular CLI project, even if you've already started to work on it.
        </p>
        <h6>Redesigned Forms</h6>
        <p>Forms have been redesigned for better usability and developer experience. Currently they are only fully supported
            in @clr/ui, but new Angular components will be arriving during 0.12 for important form controls like inputs,
            passwords, and selects.</p>
        <h6>New Spinner Button</h6>
        <p>A new type of button is now available, that allows you to set the button to a spinner while an asyncrhonous event
            occurs (such as saving or loading). You can read more about the details here
            <a href="https://github.com/vmware/clarity/issues/1488">1488</a> and documentation will be available by 0.12 release.
        </p>
    </li>
</ul>

<h2>Deprecations</h2>
<p>
    To move forward, this release comes with a number of deprecations that will be removed in future versions of Clarity. You
    should not use these features in new development, and plan for rewriting where necessary.
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <b>Code Highlight</b> will be removed, so if you happen to use it you may copy our implementation into your codebase
        or find an alternative that suits your needs.</li>
    <li>
        <b>Wizard Ghost Pages</b> will be removed, which this is an undocumented feature that we're removing.</li>
</ul>

<p>We also revamped our internal build tooling to better align with Angular's tools. Some of the early betas were published
    just to test functionality, and this was the first real beta.</p>
