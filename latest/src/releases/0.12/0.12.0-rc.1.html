        <h6>Refreshed Grid</h6>
        <p>
            Our previous grid had some limitations and was based off Bootstrap 4.0.0-alpha.5. The new grid comes prefixed with
            <code
                class="clr-code">clr-</code> so it doesn't conflict with other grid libraries and gives us better control. Another advantage is it will allow
            us to solve a number of issues with popover clipping (due to position: relative) with the old grid. Documentation
            is coming for 0.12.
