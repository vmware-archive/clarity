<ul class="list-unstyled">
    <li>
        <p>This release does not include schematics to help migration steps for 1.0 yet, so you'll have to manually
            apply the fixes listed here.</p>
        <p>To get this update, run <code class="clr-code">npm i @clr/angular@next @clr/ui@next @clr/icons@next</code>.
            The
            <code class="clr-code">@next</code> tag is necessary only while Clarity 1.0 is in prerelease, afterwards
            it won't be necessary. You can use this
            with any Angular CLI project, even if you've already started to work on it. You may need to run <code class="clr-code">ng update @angular/core @angular/cli</code>
            first to update to Angular 7.</p>
        <h6>Support for Angular 7 (<a href="https://github.com/vmware/clarity/pull/2729" target="_blank">#2729</a>)</h6>
        <p>This release brings Angular 7 support for Clarity, and this Clarity branch will be supported to work with
            Angular 7 while Angular is supported.</p>

        <h6 breaking-change>Removal of Bootstrap as a dependency (<a href="https://github.com/vmware/clarity/pull/2729"
                target="_blank">#2729</a>)</h6>
        <p>To help Clarity not depend on Bootstrap, and to avoid having dependencies with known vulnerabilities (though
            we did not use the vulnerable code anywhere), we moved the Bootstrap sass files into our project. This only
            matters to projects that have custom themes that incorporate Bootstrap, you'll now want to now import the
            Bootstrap files from <code class="clr-code">@clr/ui/utils/bootstrap/</code>.</p>

        <h6 breaking-change>Removal of deprecated Wizard API (<a href="https://github.com/vmware/clarity/pull/2758"
                target="_blank">#2758</a>)</h6>
        <p>We removed two deprecated Wizard APIs. The removed <code class="clr-code">ClrWizard.prev()</code> should be
            replaced with <code class="clr-code">ClrWizard.previous()</code>. The removed <code class="clr-code">ClrWizard.navService.setCurrentPage(1)</code>
            should be replaced with <code class="clr-code">ClrWizard.navService.currentPage = 1;</code>.</p>

        <h6 breaking-change>Removal of deprecated Datagrid features (<a href="https://github.com/vmware/clarity/pull/2756"
                target="_blank">#2756</a>)</h6>
        <p>We removed two deprecated Datagrid APIs. The ClrDgColumnToggleButton no longer has the <code class="clr-code">clrType</code>
            binding, since the OK button was removed, so you should just remove the attribute and remove any OK toggle
            button implementations you have. Also, the mistyped <code class="clr-code">clDgRowSelection</code> should
            be replaced with <code class="clr-code">clrDgRowSelection</code>.</p>

        <h6 breaking-change>Removal of deprecated Alert features (<a href="https://github.com/vmware/clarity/pull/2751"
                target="_blank">#2751</a>)</h6>
        <p>We removed two deprecated Alert APIs for the Angular component only. The alert types no longer support any
            variations that start with <code class="clr-code">alert-</code>, just remove the prefix like <code class="clr-code">info</code>.
            The first child of an ClrAlert should be <code class="clr-code">clr-alert-item</code>, to ensure the icons
            properly display.</p>

        <h6 breaking-change>Removal of deprecated icon shapes (<a href="https://github.com/vmware/clarity/pull/2750"
                target="_blank">#2750</a>)</h6>
        <p>The eye and eye-hide shapes were moved from the essentials set to the core set. If you import them directly,
            you will need to update the import path.</p>

        <h6 breaking-change>Deprecation of old grid (<a href="https://github.com/vmware/clarity/pull/2757" target="_blank">#2757</a>)</h6>
        <p>
            Clarity has had deprecated the old grid already, but has actually removed it from the main @clr/ui bundles.
            If you are still using the old grid (which includes the old unprefixed <code class="clr-code">.row</code>
            and <code class="clr-code">.col</code> classes), we have provided a temporary file you can include until
            you fully migrate to the new grid classes. To do this, add <code class="clr-code">@clr/ui/clr-grid-deprecated.css</code>
            to your project.
        </p>

        <h6 breaking-change>Deprecation of old forms (<a href="https://github.com/vmware/clarity/pull/2730" target="_blank">#2730</a>)</h6>
        <p>
            Clarity has had deprecated the old forms already, but has kept them in this release to provide more time to
            migrate. Previously to use the new forms you had to include the <code class="clr-code">ClrFormsNextModule</code>
            with the old forms as the default, but now it has been reversed. The new forms no longer need to include
            the next module, but if you wish to use the old forms still you must include the <code class="clr-code">ClrFormsDeprecatedModule</code>.
        </p>

        <h6>Two way support for ClrDatagridHideableColumn (<a href="https://github.com/vmware/clarity/pull/2738" target="_blank">#2738</a>)</h6>
        <p>
            Clarity now supports two way binding on
            <code class="clr-code">[(clrDgHidden)]</code> so you can keep track of the state more easily.
        </p>
