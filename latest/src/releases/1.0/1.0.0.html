  <li>
    <p>
      Welcome to Clarity 1.0.0! We've worked hard to get to this major milestone, and are excited about the future of Clarity! All features and changes are listed below from the beta and rc stages for an easy summary of all that changed between 0.13 and 1.0.
    </p>
    <p>This is the first release to follow our new support policy, which is to follow the Angular 7 LTS support policy as we outlined in our blog about <a href="https://medium.com/claritydesignsystem/updating-the-clarity-release-and-support-strategy-c1e37f7d5a0">our release and support strategy</a>.</p>
    <p>
      To get this update, run
      <code class="clr-code">ng update @clr/angular</code>. The <code class="clr-code">@next</code> tag is necessary only while
      You can use this with any Angular CLI project, even if you've already started to work on it. You may need to run
      <code class="clr-code">ng update @angular/core @angular/cli</code> first to update to Angular 7.
    </p>
    <h6 breaking-change>
      Refactored Tree View component (<a
        href="https://github.com/vmware/clarity/pull/2859"
        target="_blank"
        >#2859</a
      >)
    </h6>
    <p>
      The Tree View component had some internal design issues that prevented
      fixing some important bugs. This refactoring is important to address those
      problems and the old tree view has been replaced. If you use Tree View in
      your application, review the new documentation and update your uses of it.
    </p>
    <h6 breaking-change>
      Support for new checkboxes (<a
        href="https://github.com/vmware/clarity/pull/2782"
        target="_blank"
        >#2782</a
      >)
    </h6>
    <p>
      The checkboxes have been overhauled to work with the new forms, and the
      old <code class="clr-code">clr-checkbox</code> component has been removed.
    </p>

    <h6 breaking-change>
      Support new forms in login form (<a
        href="https://github.com/vmware/clarity/pull/2804"
        target="_blank"
        >#2804</a
      >)
    </h6>
    <p>
      The login page template has been updated to support the new form controls,
      with only a slight visual difference. If you do not update to the new
      forms, you'll need to be sure to include the deprecated forms module in
      your Angular module.
    </p>

    <h6 breaking-change>
      New pagination in Datagrid (<a
        href="https://github.com/vmware/clarity/pull/2754"
        target="_blank"
        >#2754</a
      >)
    </h6>
    <p>
      The new datagrid pagination is a visual improvement to the original
      pagination that also includes a new text field for users to manually input
      the page they'd like to view by entering the number directly. It also was
      a requirement for future work in the datagrid. You can also add a new
      component <code class="clr-code">clr-dg-page-size</code> which will
      display a select box for items per page.
    </p>

    <h6>
      Support for form resets and forced validation (<a
        href="https://github.com/vmware/clarity/pull/2735"
        target="_blank"
        >#2735</a
      >)
    </h6>
    <p>
      Forms have been improved to support NgControl reset methods, and can be
      forced to display validation by marking them as dirty. This helps in cases
      where you want to force validation (such as when the user submits a form
      without filling in all the fields), and when you need to clear the values
      and reset validation.
    </p>

    <h6 breaking-change>
      Set default form layout to horizontal (<a
        href="https://github.com/vmware/clarity/pull/2797"
        target="_blank"
        >#2797</a
      >)
    </h6>
    <p>
      Previously, Angular forms would default to the vertical layout, which is
      against the desired UX default. Therefore, unless you specify a different
      layout it will adopt horizontal by default with Angular forms.
    </p>

    <h6>
      Support for Angular 7 (<a
        href="https://github.com/vmware/clarity/pull/2729"
        target="_blank"
        >#2729</a
      >)
    </h6>
    <p>
      This release brings Angular 7 support for Clarity, and this Clarity branch
      will be supported to work with Angular 7 while Angular is supported.
    </p>

    <h6 breaking-change>
      Removal of Bootstrap as a dependency (<a
        href="https://github.com/vmware/clarity/pull/2729"
        target="_blank"
        >#2729</a
      >)
    </h6>
    <p>
      To help Clarity not depend on Bootstrap, and to avoid having dependencies
      with known vulnerabilities (though we did not use the vulnerable code
      anywhere), we moved the Bootstrap sass files into our project. This only
      matters to projects that have custom themes that incorporate Bootstrap,
      you'll now want to now import the Bootstrap files from
      <code class="clr-code">@clr/ui/utils/bootstrap/</code>.
    </p>

    <h6 breaking-change>
      Removal of deprecated Wizard API (<a
        href="https://github.com/vmware/clarity/pull/2758"
        target="_blank"
        >#2758</a
      >)
    </h6>
    <p>
      We removed two deprecated Wizard APIs. The removed
      <code class="clr-code">ClrWizard.prev()</code> should be replaced with
      <code class="clr-code">ClrWizard.previous()</code>. The removed
      <code class="clr-code">ClrWizard.navService.setCurrentPage(1)</code>
      should be replaced with
      <code class="clr-code">ClrWizard.navService.currentPage = 1;</code>.
    </p>

    <h6 breaking-change>
      Removal of deprecated Datagrid features (<a
        href="https://github.com/vmware/clarity/pull/2756"
        target="_blank"
        >#2756</a
      >)
    </h6>
    <p>
      We removed two deprecated Datagrid APIs. The ClrDgColumnToggleButton no
      longer has the <code class="clr-code">clrType</code> binding, since the OK
      button was removed, so you should just remove the attribute and remove any
      OK toggle button implementations you have. Also, the mistyped
      <code class="clr-code">clDgRowSelection</code> should be replaced with
      <code class="clr-code">clrDgRowSelection</code>.
    </p>

    <h6 breaking-change>
      Removal of deprecated Alert features (<a
        href="https://github.com/vmware/clarity/pull/2751"
        target="_blank"
        >#2751</a
      >)
    </h6>
    <p>
      We removed two deprecated Alert APIs for the Angular component only. The
      alert types no longer support any variations that start with
      <code class="clr-code">alert-</code>, just remove the prefix like
      <code class="clr-code">info</code>. The first child of an ClrAlert should
      be <code class="clr-code">clr-alert-item</code>, to ensure the icons
      properly display.
    </p>

    <h6 breaking-change>
      Removal of deprecated icon shapes (<a
        href="https://github.com/vmware/clarity/pull/2750"
        target="_blank"
        >#2750</a
      >)
    </h6>
    <p>
      The eye and eye-hide shapes were moved from the essentials set to the core
      set. If you import them directly, you will need to update the import path.
    </p>

    <h6 breaking-change>
      Deprecation of old grid (<a
        href="https://github.com/vmware/clarity/pull/2757"
        target="_blank"
        >#2757</a
      >)
    </h6>
    <p>
      Clarity has had deprecated the old grid already, but has actually removed
      it from the main @clr/ui bundles. If you are still using the old grid
      (which includes the old unprefixed <code class="clr-code">.row</code> and
      <code class="clr-code">.col</code> classes), we have provided a temporary
      file you can include until you fully migrate to the new grid classes. To
      do this, add
      <code class="clr-code">@clr/ui/clr-grid-deprecated.css</code> to your
      project.
    </p>

    <h6 breaking-change>
      Deprecation of old forms (<a
        href="https://github.com/vmware/clarity/pull/2730"
        target="_blank"
        >#2730</a
      >)
    </h6>
    <p>
      Clarity has had deprecated the old forms already, but has kept them in
      this release to provide more time to migrate. Previously to use the new
      forms you had to include the
      <code class="clr-code">ClrFormsNextModule</code> with the old forms as the
      default, but now it has been reversed. The new forms no longer need to
      include the next module, but if you wish to use the old forms still you
      must include the <code class="clr-code">ClrFormsDeprecatedModule</code>.
    </p>

    <h6>
      Two way support for ClrDatagridHideableColumn (<a
        href="https://github.com/vmware/clarity/pull/2738"
        target="_blank"
        >#2738</a
      >)
    </h6>
    <p>
      Clarity now supports two way binding on
      <code class="clr-code">[(clrDgHidden)]</code> so you can keep track of the
      state more easily.
    </p>
  </li>
</ul>
