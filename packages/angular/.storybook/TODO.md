# Storybook For Clarity Angular

## Broken things

1. Dark theme is included as [Object object]
2. ~~Troubleshoot which add on is breaking the storybook build w/ @clr/angular~~
3. ~~icons not showing in demo code~~
4. ~~Figma add-on seems to have issues with dark theme scale (component is very small)~~
5. Figma links need tlc - may need to partner w/ Red on this to make it work well
6. [x] Fix icons in stories
7. [ ] Updated webpack config to watch and build dark theme?

## Needed Things

1. [x] Move all form controls into a single forms story
2. [x] Basic stories for all components
3. [ ] Plans for each complex component that list the behavior we want in a story
