    <h4>Revolver (1966)</h4>
    <p>
      Revolver is the seventh studio album by the English rock band the Beatles. It was released on 5 August 1966 in the
      United Kingdom and three days later in the United States. The record spent 34 weeks on the UK Albums Chart, for
      seven of which it held the number one spot. Reduced to eleven songs for the North American market, Revolver was
      the last Beatles album to be subjected to Capitol Records' policy of altering the band's intended running order
      and content. In America, the album topped the Billboard Top LPs list for six weeks.
