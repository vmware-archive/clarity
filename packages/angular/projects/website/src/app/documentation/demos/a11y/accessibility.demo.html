      <h3 id="accessibility">Accessibility</h3>
      <p>
        Clarity tries to cover as many best practices for accessibility out of the box. However, some things are too
        application specific for Clarity to provide and we've provided some tools to make it easier when you need to
        implement custom accessibility.
      </p>

      <h3 id="aria-live-region">Aria live region</h3>
      <p>
        When content changed dynamically on the page outside of the current focus, a screen reader user would not be
        aware of those changes. In these scenarios, the browser supports the
        <code class="clr-code">aria-live</code> attribute to make important announcements. You might announce errors in
        a form, status updates for long running tasks, or alert messages.
      </p>

      <p>
        There are limitations to how different screen readers and assistive technologies support
        <code class="clr-code">aria-live</code>, and we've provided a service
        <code class="clr-code">ClrAriaLiveService</code> for your Angular application to use anytime you need to make an
        announcement in a fully compatible way.
      </p>

      <p>
        Clarity will not make any announcements by default in version 4, it is up to the application to do this when it
        makes sense. Here are a few examples of how the service works and could be used.
      </p>

      <clr-code-snippet [clrCode]="example1" [clrLanguage]="'typescript'"></clr-code-snippet>

      <p>
        Aria live regions have three levels, <code class="clr-code">off</code> to disable it,
        <code class="clr-code">polite</code> to announce to the user at the next opportunity (default), and
        <code class="clr-code">assertive</code> to alert the user immediately and interrupt any other announcements in
        progress.
      </p>
      <clr-code-snippet [clrCode]="example2" [clrLanguage]="'typescript'"></clr-code-snippet>

      <h5 id="aria-live-integration">Integration</h5>
      <p>
        A working example of using <code class="clr-code">ClrAriaLiveService</code> with a download, asynchronous
        process is below. You start by injecting the service, and based on changes in the progress state it will
        announce updates of the percentage updates. You might also want to debounce messages if you expect to get them
        very quickly so you don't have too many rapid announcements and annoy the users.
