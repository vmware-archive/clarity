<h2>Usage guidelines</h2>

<h4 id="for-structured-content">For Structured Content</h4>

<p>
  Datagrids work best for structured, homogeneous content, where each object has the same attributes. When common
  attributes are directly aligned in columns, users can quickly scan and compare them.
</p>

<p>
  For data sets with a blend of text, images, and data visualizations, or content with mixed formatting,
  <a routerLink="../cards">cards</a> offer a better layout.
</p>

<h4 id="for-large-volumes-of-data">For Large Volumes of Data</h4>

<p>
  A datagrid is well-suited for presenting large volumes of data that donâ€™t fit on one page. Users can filter and sort
  the data according to preference.
</p>

<p>For smaller amounts of data (10 to 20 lines), datagrids are a relatively heavy component. Use datagrids if:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The data set will grow</li>
  <li>Users need search, filter, or batch operations</li>
</ul>

<p>
  For a smaller volume of data, use a <a routerLink="../tables">table</a>. Tables are a lighter-weight solution with a
  static view.
</p>
