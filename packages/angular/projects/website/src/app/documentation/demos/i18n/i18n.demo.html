            There is a breaking change required to fix the language support starting in version 2.1.1 and 1.2.1. The
            original implementation was broken in a way that could not be fixed with the original API, and due to the
            importance of this service for localization we opted to introduce a different API. If you have an
            implementation of a custom language strings before this release,
            <a routerLink="./" fragment="updating-to-latest">follow the instructions</a> on how to update your code.

      </clr-alert>

      <h3 id="design-guidelines">Internal language strings</h3>
      <p>
        Clarity has a list of text strings that it uses internally for things such as icon alt text or button text. When
        possible, Clarity avoids using text strings that have to be translated, and rarely changes this list. Any
        Angular application that needs to support multiple languages can create a different translation and use it for
        each language.
      </p>

      <p>
        In order to improve accessibility of its components, Clarity added a default English title to all icons or
        non-text interactive elements internal to its components. In order to internationalize them we rely on a
        <code class="clr-code">ClrCommonStringsService</code> service that allows you to provide localized strings for
        your entire app, which will override our default titles.
      </p>
      <h3 id="examples">How to Localize</h3>

      <p>
        First, you need to make a new object that has a key value pair for each string you want to localize. You only
        need to define the strings that you need for your application.
      </p>

      <pre><code clr-code-highlight="language-ts" ngNonBindable>
export const klingonLocale: ClrCommonStrings = &#123;
  open: 'ghIt',
  close: 'SoQmoH'
&#125;
</code></pre>
      <p>Then you'll need to inject the</p>
      <pre><code clr-code-highlight="language-ts" ngNonBindable>
import &#123; ClrCommonStringsService &#125; from '@clr/angular';
import &#123; klingonLocale &#125; from './translations/klingon';

@Component(&#123;...&#125;)
export class AppComponent &#123;
  constructor(commonStrings: ClrCommonStringsService) &#123;
    // Call this method to set the new locale values into the service, defaults for English
    // will be used for in any missing strings
    commonStrings.localize(klingonLocale);
  &#125;
&#125;
</code></pre>

      <p>
        It is possible to call the <code class="clr-code">ClrCommonStringsService.localize()</code> method at anytime
        and change the translation. You could call a backend service to load these translation strings as well and then
        update them on the fly when a user changes translations in your app.
      </p>

      <pre><code clr-code-highlight="language-ts" ngNonBindable>
@Injectable()
export class MyCommonStringsService implements ClrCommonStrings &#123;
  constructor(@Inject(LOCALE_ID) locale: string, server: MyServer, commonStrings: ClrCommonStringsService) &#123;
    // Imagine this service loads a JSON object of strings for a locale
    server.fetchTexts(locale).subscribe(texts =&gt; &#123;
      // Pass the new localization strings to the service
      commonStrings.localize(texts);
      ...
    &#125;);
  &#125;
&#125;
    </code></pre>

      <h3>Localization Strings</h3>
      <p>
        The list of strings available to configure can be found by simply looking at the declaration of the
        <code class="clr-code">ClrCommonStrings</code> interface, which is found below.
      </p>
      <table class="table">
        <thead>
          <tr>
            <th class="left">Property name</th>
            <th class="left">Purpose</th>
          </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
          <tr *ngFor="let string of strings">
            <td class="left">{{ string.key }}</td>
            <td class="left">{{ string.role }}</td>
          </tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>

      <h3 id="updating-to-latest">Updating to v1.2.1 or 2.1.1</h3>

      <p>
        If you used the original implementation of <code class="clr-code">ClrCommonStrings</code> found in versions
        prior to v1.2.1 and v2.1.1, you need to follow these steps to update to the new API.
      </p>

      <p>
        1. Remove the provider from your <code class="clr-code">AppModule</code>. It should have looked something like
        the following.
      </p>

      <pre><code clr-code-highlight="language-ts" ngNonBindable>
@NgModule(&#123;
  imports: [...],
  declarations: [...],
  providers: [&#123; provide: ClrCommonStrings, useClass: MyCommonStringsService &#125;]
&#125;)
export class AppModule &#123;&#125;
      </code></pre>

      <p>
        2. Convert your string service class to an object. This is optional but makes for easier formatting. If you skip
        this step, you'll have to create a new instance of your class to convert it to an object.
      </p>

      <pre><code clr-code-highlight="language-ts" ngNonBindable>
// Old class format
export class MyCommonStringsService implements ClrCommonStrings &#123;
  open = 'ghIt';
  close = 'SoQmoH';
&#125;

// New object format
export const klingonLocale: ClrCommonStrings = &#123;
  open: 'ghIt',
  close: 'SoQmoH'
&#125;
</code></pre>

      <p>
        3. You can now inject the <code class="clr-code">ClrCommonStringsService</code> into your
        <code class="clr-code">AppComponent</code> and pass in the localized strings, as shown above.
      </p>

      <p>
        The previous implementation was broken because unless each application declared the provider themselves, none of
        the localization strings would remain after a production build and tree shaking. The refactoring that was done
        keeps the defaults inside of Clarity so they do not get removed, and allows applications the ability to still
        provide custom language strings for localization.
