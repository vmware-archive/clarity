<p>
  Each panel representing each step will contain a title and a description that describes the entire workflow at a
  glance. After completing each step, collapsed panels then replace step descriptions with summaries describing what the
  user has accomplished.
</p>

<h4>
  Here is when you might want to use a stepper over normal forms or wizards:
</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Complex and long work processes that may not fit in one viewport</li>
  <li>When the user would need to see the forms in-line with the rest of the page content</li>
  <li>If users need more detail than step titles to understand the process.</li>
  <li>If summaries of previous steps are helpful in informing next steps.</li>
</ul>

<p>
  Steppers are composed of two sections, the stepper header and input section.
</p>

<h5>Stepper Header Section</h5>

<p>
  The step title section has three states: completed, active, to-do. When a step is in its active state, its title
  section will be highlighted and its input section will be visible for users to interact. As users complete steps, the
  steps are marked with a green bar to the left, and a summary of user's input will replace the description.
</p>

<h5>Input Section</h5>

<p>
  The input section has two elements: the form and the buttons. The form is used to collect input from users to finish
  the step. The buttons section will allow the users to proceed to the next step or finish the workflow. To go back to a
  previous step, users need to click on the step title of one of the previous steps. That step will become the active
  step with its input section visible for editing.

          Use clear copy in the final call to action to best represent the action that users are taking in completing
          the stepper.

<h5>Final Call to Action</h5>

<p>
  For the button label in the final call to action, we recommend that the copy also describe an immediate outcome of
  completing a stepper. If the workflow will require more time to process after the stepper is complete, then FINISH or
  other non-specific terminology may work better.
</p>

<p>
  Though we recommend action-oriented button labels, there are use cases where labels like DONE work well. If the user
  is viewing read-only information, we recommend using labels like DONE.
