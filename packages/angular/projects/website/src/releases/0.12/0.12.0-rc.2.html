<h2>Bug Fixes</h2>
<ul class="list">
  <li bug-fix>
    Updated paths for theme SCSS files so developers can again use custom themes. Apps must now add
    <code class="clr-code"><span class="nobr">--include-path=node_modules</span></code> to their SCSS build step to
    correctly build a custom theme. See Themes documentation for more details. (<a
