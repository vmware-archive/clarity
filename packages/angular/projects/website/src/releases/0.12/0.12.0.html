<h2>Highlights</h2>
<ul class="list-unstyled whats-new-highlights">
  <li>
    <h6 breaking-change>Angular 6 support</h6>
    <p>
      Clarity has updated to run with Angular 6 and Rxjs 6 without the need for the rxjs-compat layer. The 0.12 release
      is only certified to work with Angular 6 and above.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h6>Support for Angular CLI <code class="clr-code">ng add</code></h6>
    <p>
      Clarity can now be installed using Angular CLI v6+ by simply running the following:
      <code class="clr-code">ng add @clr/angular</code>. You can use this with any Angular CLI project, even if you've
      already started to work on it.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h6>Redesigned Forms</h6>
    <p>
      Forms have been redesigned for better usability and developer experience. Currently they are only fully supported
      in @clr/ui, but new Angular components will be arriving during 0.12 for important form controls like inputs,
      passwords, and selects.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li breaking-change>
    <h6>New Spinner Button</h6>
    <p>
      A new type of button is now available, that allows you to set the button to a spinner while an asynchronous event
      occurs (such as saving or loading). You can read more about the details here
      <a href="https://github.com/vmware/clarity/issues/1488">1488</a> and updated documentation can be found
      <a routerLink="/documentation/v0.12/buttons">here</a> under the Loading Buttons section.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h6>Refreshed Grid</h6>
    <p>
      Our previous grid had some limitations and was based off Bootstrap 4.0.0-alpha.5. The new grid comes prefixed with
      <code class="clr-code">clr-</code> so it doesn't conflict with other grid libraries and gives us better control.
      Another advantage is it will allow us to solve a number of issues with popover clipping (due to position:
      relative) with the old grid. Refer to our <a routerLink="/documentation/v0.12/grid">documentation</a> for more
      details.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h6>
      Input and form control validation components
    </h6>
    <p>
      Angular input form control, which has built in validation support for template-driven or reactive forms. This is
      the first of the upcoming Angular form controls.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li breaking-change>
    <h6>Shape deprecations in Clarity Icons</h6>
    <p>
      Clarity Icons v0.12 has deprecated some icons in their respective sets and moved to other sets:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><code class="clr-code">wand</code> has been moved to "essential-shapes" from "media-shapes"</li>
      <li><code class="clr-code">angle-double</code> has been moved to "core-shapes" from "essential-shapes"</li>
      <li>
        <code class="clr-code">calendar</code> and <code class="clr-code">event</code> have been moved to "core-shapes"
        from "social-shapes"
      </li>
      <li>
        <code class="clr-code">bar-chart</code> and <code class="clr-code">line-chart</code> have been moved to
        "chart-shapes" from "technology-shapes"
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Deprecations</h2>
<p>
  To move forward, this release comes with a number of deprecations that will be removed in future versions of Clarity.
  You should not use these features in new development, and plan for rewriting where necessary.
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <b>Code Highlight</b> will be removed, so if you happen to use it you may copy our implementation into your codebase
    or find an alternative that suits your needs.
  </li>
  <li><b>Wizard Ghost Pages</b> will be removed, which this is an undocumented feature that we're removing.</li>
</ul>

<p>
  We also revamped our internal build tooling to better align with Angular's tools. Some of the early betas were
  published just to test functionality, and this was the first real beta.
</p>

<h2>Bug Fixes</h2>
<ul class="list">
  <li bug-fix>
    Updated paths for theme SCSS files so developers can again use custom themes. Apps must now add
    <code class="clr-code"><span class="nobr">--include-path=node_modules</span></code> to their SCSS build step to
    correctly build a custom theme. See Themes documentation for more details. (<a
