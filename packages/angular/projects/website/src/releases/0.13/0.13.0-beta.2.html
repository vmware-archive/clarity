<h2>Highlights</h2>
<ul class="list-unstyled whats-new-highlights">
  <li>
    <h6 breaking-change>Removal of the undocumented ghost pages feature from the wizard.</h6>
    <p>
      The wizard has had an undocumented ghost pages feature, which was removed. If you happened upon this feature and
      are using it, you'll need to remove it from your wizards.
    </p>

    <h6 breaking-change>Removal of the code highlight component.</h6>
    <p>
      The code highlight component was removed as it was deprecated and planned to be removed. If you use it, you have a
      few options.
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>Use another code highlighting module, several can be found on NPM.</li>
      <li>
        Implement your own version of the code highlight functionality, and you can
        <a href="https://github.com/vmware/clarity/blob/website/latest/src/app/utils/code-snippet.ts"
          >reference our implementation for this website</a
        >.
      </li>
    </ol>

    <h6 breaking-change>Removal of old grid push and pull features.</h6>
    <p>
      The old grid push/pull functionality was deprecated and causes a number of issues with popovers and clipping
      overflow content. The solution is to migrate to the new grid formatting.
    </p>

    <h6 breaking-change>Removal of non-prefixed Clarity API.</h6>
    <p>
      In 0.11, all non-prefixed Clarity classes were deprecated, such as <code class="clr-code">Wizard</code>. The
      correct implementation is always to use the prefixed version now like <code class="clr-code">ClrWizard</code>.
    </p>

    <h6 breaking-change>Removal of the OK button in datagrid column selector.</h6>
    <p>
      This is a visual breaking change, where we removed the OK button from the datagrid column toggle popover. If you
      have been using the <code class="clr-code">clr-dg-column-toggle-button</code> button to localize the button text,
      you can safely remove the OK button as well. This component will now only be used for the Select All text
      localization. The <code class="clr-code">clrType</code> binding has also been deprecated since it will now not be
      needed.
    </p>

    <h6>Automatically upgrading using <code class="clr-code">ng update</code></h6>
    <p>
      Some of the changes above can be automatically migrated in an Angular CLI project by running
      <code class="clr-code">ng update @clr/angular@0.13.0-beta.2</code>. You may need to run
      <code class="clr-code">ng update @angular/core</code> first, and if you run into issues the best solution is to do
      a git reset, reinstall node modules, and try again.
    </p>

    <p>This release also includes all bugfixes from the 0.12 releases.</p>
