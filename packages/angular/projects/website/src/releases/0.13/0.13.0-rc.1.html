<h2>Highlights</h2>
<ul class="list-unstyled whats-new-highlights">
  <li>
    <h6>New ClrRadio form component.</h6>
    <p>
      The forms now include a radio component for managing your radio buttons in an Angular form.
    </p>

    <h6 breaking-change>Removal of deprecated icons.</h6>
    <p>
      Some icon shapes have been moved to a different set and this may impact your imports if you use those specific
      icons. Verify if you are using the following and view the icons documentation for
      <code class="clr-code">angle-double</code>, <code class="clr-code">bar-chart</code>,
      <code class="clr-code">collapse</code>, <code class="clr-code">line-chart</code>, and
      <code class="clr-code">wand</code> to see which set they belong to.
    </p>

    <h6>Automatically upgrading using <code class="clr-code">ng update</code></h6>
    <p>
      Some of the changes above can be automatically migrated in an Angular CLI project by running
      <code class="clr-code">ng update @clr/angular@0.13.0-rc.1</code>. You may need to run
      <code class="clr-code">ng update @angular/core</code> first, and if you run into issues the best solution is to do
      a git reset, reinstall node modules, and try again.
    </p>

    <p>This release also includes all bugfixes from the 0.12 releases.</p>
