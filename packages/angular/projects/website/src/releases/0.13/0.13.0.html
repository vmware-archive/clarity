<h2>Highlights</h2>
<ul class="list-unstyled whats-new-highlights">
  <li>
    Clarity 0.13 is the final release before we go to 1.0! This release includes a number of breaking changes in the
    pre-release versions, and a number of new features. To help understand what changed in 0.13, all changes are posted
    below again for you.
  </li>
  <li>
    <h6>Support for Angular CLI <code class="clr-code">ng update</code></h6>
    <p>
      Clarity can now be updated using Angular CLI v6+ by simply running the following:
      <code class="clr-code">ng update @clr/angular</code>. You can use this with any Angular CLI project, even if
      you've already started to work on it. You may need to run
      <code class="clr-code">ng update @angular/core</code> first to update Angular by running
      <code class="clr-code">ng update @angular/core</code>.
    </p>
    <h6 breaking-change>
      Removal of <code class="clr-code">forRoot</code> and <code class="clr-code">forChild</code> in ClarityModule
    </h6>
    <p>
      Clarity has had deprecated methods for the ClarityModule, both which have been removed in this release. They are
      not utilized and if you use them just simply remove them so anywhere you import Clarity should just be
      <code class="clr-code">ClarityModule</code> in your imports array.
    </p>
    <h6>Select component</h6>
    <p>
      The new forms now have a Select component, which provides validation and behaviors for the HTML select element.
    </p>
    <h6>Datagrid Typing</h6>
    <p>
      You can now pass in stronger typing information into Datagrid components. See
      <a href="https://github.com/vmware/clarity/pull/2347" target="_blank">PR 2347</a> for more details.
    </p>
    <h6 breaking-change>Removal of the undocumented ghost pages feature from the wizard.</h6>
    <p>
      The wizard has had an undocumented ghost pages feature, which was removed. If you happened upon this feature and
      are using it, you'll need to remove it from your wizards.
    </p>

    <h6 breaking-change>Removal of the code highlight component.</h6>
    <p>
      The code highlight component was removed as it was deprecated and planned to be removed. If you use it, you have a
      few options.
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>Use another code highlighting module, several can be found on NPM.</li>
      <li>
        Implement your own version of the code highlight functionality, and you can
        <a href="https://github.com/vmware/clarity/blob/website/latest/src/app/utils/code-snippet.ts"
          >reference our implementation for this website</a
        >.
      </li>
    </ol>

    <h6 breaking-change>Removal of old grid push and pull features.</h6>
    <p>
      The old grid push/pull functionality was deprecated and causes a number of issues with popovers and clipping
      overflow content. The solution is to migrate to the new grid formatting.
    </p>

    <h6 breaking-change>Removal of non-prefixed Clarity API.</h6>
    <p>
      In 0.11, all non-prefixed Clarity classes were deprecated, such as <code class="clr-code">Wizard</code>. The
      correct implementation is always to use the prefixed version now like <code class="clr-code">ClrWizard</code>.
    </p>

    <h6 breaking-change>Removal of the OK button in datagrid column selector.</h6>
    <p>
      This is a visual breaking change, where we removed the OK button from the datagrid column toggle popover. If you
      have been using the <code class="clr-code">clr-dg-column-toggle-button</code> button to localize the button text,
      you can safely remove the OK button as well. This component will now only be used for the Select All text
      localization. The <code class="clr-code">clrType</code> binding has also been deprecated since it will now not be
      needed.
    </p>

    <h6>New ClrRadio form component.</h6>
    <p>
      The forms now include a radio component for managing your radio buttons in an Angular form.
    </p>

    <h6 breaking-change>Removal of deprecated icons.</h6>
    <p>
      Some icon shapes have been moved to a different set and this may impact your imports if you use those specific
      icons. Verify if you are using the following and view the icons documentation for
      <code class="clr-code">angle-double</code>, <code class="clr-code">bar-chart</code>,
      <code class="clr-code">collapse</code>, <code class="clr-code">line-chart</code>, and
      <code class="clr-code">wand</code> to see which set they belong to.
    </p>

    <p>This release also includes all bugfixes from the 0.12 releases.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
