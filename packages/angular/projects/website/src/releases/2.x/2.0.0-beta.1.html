      This release brings Angular 8-beta.5 support for Clarity, and this Clarity branch will be supported to work with
      Angular 8 while Angular is supported.

    <h6 breaking-change>
      Simplifying color variables and removing luminance and contrast maps(<a

    </h6>
    <p>
      We've cleaned up a lot of variables and simplified the CSS theming to make it easier to work with. Custom themes
      may need to review their themes for any referenced maps and some new variables were added to capture some missing
      configurations.
