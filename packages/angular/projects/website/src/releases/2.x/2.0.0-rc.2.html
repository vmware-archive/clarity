<h2>Highlights</h2>
<h3>Angular 8.0.0-rc.3</h3>
<p>
  To get this update, run <code class="clr-code">ng update @clr/angular@next</code>. The
  <code class="clr-code">@next</code> tag is necessary only while this is in prerelease, afterwards it won't be
  necessary. You can use this with any Angular CLI project, even if you've already started to work on it. You may need
  to run <code class="clr-code">ng update @angular/core @angular/cli</code> first to update to Angular 8.0.0-rc.3 or
  greater.
</p>
