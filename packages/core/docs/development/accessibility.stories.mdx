# Accessibility

Core components follow the same Accessibility standards as clr-angular.
They should try to encapsulate a11y best practices with few exceptions.

## Common Strings and i18n

Currently, we use a `CommonStrings` service similar to the one in clr-angular.
In version 5, we will be updating all components to use a new single unified API
that will allow internal strings to be set for a11y and i18n. This new API Also
will allow not only global level common strings but component instance-specific
strings.

## Aria Attributes

Most aria labels can and should be safely encapsulated within the component.
Encapsulated aria attributes should only reflect the state given
to the component and remain stateless, not tracking any state. Example:

```html
<cds-tag>hello there</cds-tag>

<cds-tag readonly>hello there</cds-tag>
```

When rendered the following output is given:

```html
<cds-tag tabindex="0" role="button">hello there</cds-tag>

<cds-tag readonly>hello there</cds-tag>
```

## Aria Live

The `aria-live` attribute should not be used within a Core component due to
the risk of triggering too many announcements. The use of `aria-live` should be
managed by the application.

```html
<span cds-layout="display:screen-reader-only" aria-live="polite">
  This will be announced by the screen reader but visibly hidden.
</span>
```

## Element Associations with DescribedBy

Using associative aria elements such as `aria-describedby` or `id` + `for` are
safe to use within one rule. The associated elements must exist within the same
DOM boundary and not cross between the light or shadow DOM. Example:

```html
<cds-input label="my cool label">
  <input type="text" />
</cds-input>
```

The `cds-input` could take a label as an input property and apply the text to the
label with an associated id. However, in the example, the HTML input exists within
the light DOM and is projected into the component slot. The label element would exist
within the shadow DOM and template of the component.

```html
<cds-input label="my cool label">
  <shadow-root>
    <label for="some-id">${this.label}</label>
    <!-- this is in the shadow DOM -->
    <slot></slot>
  </shadow-root>
  <input type="text" />
  <!-- this is in the light DOM -->
</cds-input>
```

```typescript

connectedCallback() {
  this.querySelector('input').id = 'some-id';
}
```

This breaks the rule and will fail to link the label and input. Also, this is a
poor API design as it restricts the label only to have basic string text. An
improvement would be to move both the label and input to the same DOM level.

```html
<cds-input>
  <label>my cool label</label>
  <input type="text" />
</cds-input>
```

The component then can query and set the appropriate attributes.

```html
<cds-input>
  <label for="some-id">my cool label</label>
  <input type="text" id="some-id" />
</cds-input>
```
