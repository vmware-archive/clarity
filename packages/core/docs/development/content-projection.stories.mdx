# Content Projection (Slots)

<cds-alert-group status="warning" cds-layout="m-y:lg">
  <cds-alert>
    Slot behavior is similar to ng-content in Angular. Treat slot as if it does not exist at runtime.
  </cds-alert>
</cds-alert-group>

Don't use slot selectors in JS or CSS as it's just for marking where the content
will be projected. We do not use named slots in our public API but rather provide wrapper components.
This improves developer experience by allowing application developers to learn only our API of
components as opposed to having to understand named slots and our slot-naming conventions.

```html
<cds-modal>
  <cds-modal-header></cds-modal-header>
  <cds-modal-body></cds-modal-body>
  <cds-modal-actions></cds-modal-actions>
</cds-modal>
```

Internally we use named slots but automatically add the named slot.

```html
<!-- cds-modal template -->
<slot name="header"></slot>
<slot></slot>
<slot name="actions"></slot>
```

```typescript
// cds-modal-actions
connectedCallback() {
  super.connectedCallback();
  this.setAttribute('slot', 'actions');
}
```

The Web Component can apply styles to content provided by the application
using the `::slotted` CSS selector. However, we should avoid applying any
styles that may alter the provided content's layout. The host application should
manage layout as we do not want to assume layout use cases. A component can provide
a default layout for projected content but ensure that custom provided
layouts still behave as expected.

```html
<cds-modal>
  <div cds-layout="vertical gap:md">
    ...
  </div>
</cds-modal>
```

The `slot` tag can vary in style behavior between browsers. Most treat the
tag with `display: contents` style or similar behavior. This behavior treats as
if the tag does not exist so CSS styles will ignore it.

```scss
// my-component css
.wrapper {
  display: flex;
  gap: 12px;
}
```

```html
<!-- my-component html -->
<div class="wrapper">
  <slot></slot>
</div>
```

Each item projected will have the set 12px gap in the flexbox parent. The slot
is ignored and not treated as the direct child of the `.wrapper` element.

```html
<my-component>
  <p>item</p>
  <p>item</p>
  <p>item</p>
</my-component>
```
