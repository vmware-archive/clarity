# Getting Started - Contributing to Clarity Core

### Code Conventions, Patterns, and Internal APIs

To ensure the highest quality and maintainability for Clarity Web Components, we
adhere to the following guidelines for our Core Web Component codebase.

<cds-alert-group status="warning" cds-layout="m-t:lg">
  <cds-alert>
    Internal APIs are not to be used in application code. They are for the use of Clarity Components only and do not
    follow our standard release cycle.
  </cds-alert>
</cds-alert-group>

## Philosophy

- Web standards over frameworks.
- Lightweight, only ship what you need.
- Accessible by default.
- Minimally Stateful Components
- Automated/Build enforced code conventions and performance.

## New Components

- New components should go through our standard [Development Contribution Guidelines](https://github.com/vmware/clarity/blob/master/docs/CONTRIBUTING_DEVELOPMENT.md).
  New components that have an accepted proposal and API design will need to follow
  the code conventions, as described in this outline. New components will need to
  have a new Storybook Story for the full API, as well as any additional common
  use cases as additional stories.

```
## Github API Proposal Template Example

## Basic Usage

`<cds-alert status="success" closable>This is an Alert</cds-alert>`

## API

_Describe the intended API_

### Element
- `cds-alert`

### Properties/Attributes
- `status: 'default' | 'info' | 'warning' | 'danger' | 'success'`: sets the color and icon style
- `closable: boolean`: determines if close icon should be visible

### Custom Events
- `closeChange`: emit when the close button is clicked by user

## Slots
- `default`: only one default slot

### CSS Custom Properties
- `--background`
- `--color`
```

## Project Design

- Components should be as stateless as possible – leaning on the host application framework to manage state.
- Stateless components prevent "escape hatches" or additional APIs added to change the default stateful behavior.
- Stateless internal utilities should default to being pure JavaScript functions instead of Classes.
- Stateful logic between components when necessary should be encapsulated in a
  Class following our Service conventions described in this document.

## Starting Up

1. Clone the repository https://github.com/vmware/clarity
2. Ensure you have yarn 1.x (classic) installed https://classic.yarnpkg.components
3. In the root directory run `yarn`
4. Start project `cd projects/core && yarn run start`. This starts storybook and the build watcher.
5. Run Unit test watcher `cd projects/core && yarn run test:watch`

To run a full repository build in the root directory run the following:

```bash
yarn run build && yarn run build:website
```

This is the same build tasks ran by the CI check-in process.
