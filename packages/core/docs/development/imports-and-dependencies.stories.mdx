# Imports and Dependencies

Core cannot take on any third-party dependencies other than the dependencies
defined in the project already. Core also cannot have any dependencies on
Clarity Angular. This restriction is to ensure proper tree shaking and performance standards.

Core has the following direct dependencies:

- [lit-element](https://lit-element.polymer-project.org/) is a
  lightweight base class that provides syntactic sugar to Web Components.
- [Ramda JS](https://ramdajs.com/) for common functional utilities. To use
  Currying, use the `curryN` function for TypeScript support.

## Internal Imports

When developing a Core Component, it's important to know the import modules available.
Each component is treated as a separate entry point. This means each component can
be imported independently without needing to share the same import path. Entry points
enforce a strong boundary of separation between component responsibilities and
help tools better tree shake.

Public components should remain on the root of the src directory to ensure the
import path remains consistent throughout the library.

```bash
/src
  /alert
  /button
  /modal
  /input
  /radio
```

```typescript
import '@cds/core/alert/register.js';
import '@cds/core/button/register.js';
import '@cds/core/modal/register.js';
import '@cds/core/input/register.js';
import '@cds/core/radio/register.js';
```

## Shared Component Code

Any common shared code between component entry points should exist within the `@cds/core/internal` module.

```typescript
// cool-widget.element.ts
import { SharedUtil } from '@cds/core/internal';
import { CdsButton } from '@cds/core/button';

export class CdsCoolWidget {}
```

Any component-specific code can be kept within the components directory but should
be referenced with a local path ending with `.js`.

```typescript
// cool-widget.element.ts
import { SharedUtil } from '@cds/core/internal';
import { CdsButton } from '@cds/core/button';
import { componentSpecificUtil } from './utils.js';

export class CdsCoolWidget {}
```

The `.js` is necessary as TypeScript [does not append the extension](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript/issues/16577)
when compiled to plain JavaScript. The `.js` extension is required for valid
ES modules. The file is referred to with a local path as this exists within
the component directory itself and does not need to be publicly exposed on the
bare module import.

## Shared Internal Components

Any components that may be shared between public API components should be their
own entry point but moved to `internal-components`. By keeping each internal
component an isolated entry point/registry, we can ensure optimal tree shaking.

Internal components should be prefixed with `cds-internal` to make it clear
to users what components are safe for use. Internal components can be documented
under the Internal/API section in storybook. See the `cds-internal-close-button`
for an example to get started with.

```bash
/src
  /alert
  /button
  /internal
  /internal-components
    /close-button
```

```typescript
import '@cds/core/alert/register.js';
import '@cds/core/button/register.js';
import '@cds/core/internal-components/close-button/register.js';
```

```html
<cds-internal-close-button></cds-internal-close-button>
```
