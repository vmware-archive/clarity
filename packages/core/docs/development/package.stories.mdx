# Publishing and Package Artifacts

Core ships modern ESM2020+ JavaScript under the `@cds/core` name on [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@cds/core).
We do not compile down to ES5 or bundle/minify the code. The recommended way to
ship Web Components is modern ES code and allow the app to compile/bundle as
needed. This strategy gets us the broadest amount of tooling support. Here are
some excellent resources and deploy checklists on the topic:

- https://open-wc.org/publishing/
- https://justinfagnani.com/2019/11/01/how-to-publish-web-components-to-npm/

By avoiding bundles, we can support performant build-less options with CDNs.

- https://unpkg.com/ (good generic CDN with module resolution)
- https://skypack.dev (this has excellent performance characteristics)
- https://www.snowpack.dev (a local tool for module resolution but no bundling/build step needed)

It is recommended consumers use a build step to tree-shake and optimize their
application build. This will help ensure dependencies are deduped, and peer
dependencies are correctly managed.

## Release Cycle

All new components go through a two-stage release cycle. Once a component is
completed and merged, it will be released as under preview. Each new component
remains in preview for about six months or one major release cycle. After the
preview cycle, it will move into stable and follow our standard semver policy.

By providing a six-month preview window, we give early adopters a chance to start
trying out the component sooner but allow a bit more flexibility if an API breaking
change is required before going stable.

## Library Authors using Core

<cds-alert-group status="danger" cds-layout="m-y:lg">
  <cds-alert>Custom Element tags names are global!</cds-alert>
</cds-alert-group>

If you ship a library that contains Clarity Core Web Components as a dependency,
be aware that custom element tags names are global to the DOM. To prevent version
conflicts, you will need to list Core as a peer dependency in your library.
This will help applications at build time resolve to a single shared version
of the Core components. Peer dependencies are currently the only way to manage
dependencies with Web Components. This is due to Web Components being registered
in the global scope.
See: [Custom Elements Scoped Registry support](https://github.com/w3c/webcomponents/issues/716).
