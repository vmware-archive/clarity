# Public API Conventions

## Component APIs

- Custom Elements (Web Components) should be prefixed with `cds-`.
- There is no prefix on public custom element attributes or properties as they
  are scoped to the custom element.
- Style attributes related to sizes should use t-shirt style values. Example
  `size="sm"` ... xs, sm, md, lg, xl xxl
- Events/props should follow Angular/Vue style naming conventions of using a
  present tense verb + `change`. Example, property `open` and event `openChange`.

These component conventions allow frameworks to consume the Web easily. The convention
is also needed so extend libraries like our React wrappers `@clr/react` can parse
and set up the React version of the event. `closeChange` => `onCloseChange`.

Components primarily communicate the following ways:

```
1. properties/attrs (data in)
2. custom events (data out)
3. slots (content projection)
```

## Properties vs Attributes

Most frameworks provide a templating syntax to set JavaScript properties on a component.
Example:

```typescript
const modal = document.querySelector('cds-modal');
modal.closable = false; // setting the JavaScript object property
```

If I am using a framework like Angular I can use the template binding to
set the property.

```html
<cds-modal [closable]="booleanValue"></cds-modal>
```

Lit-element will automatically sync attributes and properties together unless
specified otherwise. While attributes are always string values in HTML, lit-element
and the `@property` decorator will attempt to convert the attribute value based
on the value type that was set on the `@property` decorator.

### Primititve Values Only

While lit-element keeps both properties and attributes in sync we do not use
complex object types like `object` and `array` on the API. Since HTML cannot represent
JavaScript objects, lit-element must JSON parse attributes and reflect them anytime
there is a change to ensure the JavaScript property and HTML attribute are in sync.
This can be expensive to parse when using `object` or `array` and cause unexpected
behaviors such as lost object references for the user.

#### Use

- `string`
- `number`
- `boolean`

#### Avoid

- `object`
- `array`

Using `object` and `array` also causes compatibility and usablity issues as it
now requires the developer to use JavaScript to render content. This can make it
difficult for user generated content like CMS systems or SSR (Server Side Rendering)
that may only be able to easily render static HTML.

The **only** exception to this practice is the `i18n` API. This API requires
JavaScript property usage or object parsing in the HTML. This is primarily due to
the number of dynamic internal strings which can change on a component. When
using the `i18n` API we encourage developers to bind to the propery instead of
the attribute to bypass any of the downsides or unexpected behaviors of attr
object parsing as described above.

## Example APIs

Here are some examples of what the syntax of different frameworks look like
when interacting with a Custom Element.

### Angular

Angular can set attributes or properties. To set a property use the `[prop]`]
syntax. To listen to an event use the `(event)` syntax.

```html
<!--
  - `size` is set as an HTML attribute so no binding syntax is used
  - [closable] is setting a property on the element
  - (closeChange) is listening for the `closeChange` custom event
-->
<cds-modal size="lg" [closable]="booleanValue" (closeChange)="log($event.detail)">
  <p>slot content</p>
</cds-modal>
```

### VueJS

Vue can set attributes or properties. To set a property use the `:prop` syntax.
To listen to an event use the `@event` syntax.

```html
<!--
  - `size` is set as an HTML attribute so no binding syntax is used
  - :closable is setting a property on the element
  - @closeChange is listening for the `closeChange` custom event
-->
<cds-modal size="lg" :closable="booleanValue" @closeChange="log($event.detail)">
  <p>slot content</p>
</cds-modal>
```

### React + @clr/react wrappers

<cds-alert-group status="danger" cds-layout="m-y:lg">
  <cds-alert>
    React requires use of the @clr/react package to workaround
    <a cds-text="link" href="https://custom-elements-everywhere.com/#react">
      several open issues
    </a>.
  </cds-alert>
</cds-alert-group>

```jsx
/*
  - `size` unlike the examples above `size` is set as a property
  - closable is setting a property on the element
  - onCloseChange is listening for the `closeChange` custom event
*/
<CdsModal size="lg" closable={this.state.booleanValue} onCloseChange={this.log}>
  <p>slot content</p>
</CdsModal>
```

## Public Import APIs

Public Components are exported with a side effect free file import. Public
Utilities are only exported through the top-level import path. To register a
component to use, we export a stand-alone `register.js` side effect import.

```typescript
import { CommonStrings } from '@cds/core'; // utilities
import { CdsButton } from '@cds/core/button'; // component class
import '@cds/core/button/register.js'; // register and use component
```

By keeping the component registration as a separate side effect import, we ensure
proper tree shaking at a component and symbol level. This convention also [future
proofs our API to allow our components to be aliased](https://github.com/w3c/webcomponents/issues/716).

Overall we try to avoid users from importing anything by direct file
or with deep import paths as this is reaching into the library internals, which
can change. The `@cds/core/internal` module is an internal private module for shared
utilities between components.
