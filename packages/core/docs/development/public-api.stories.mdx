# Public API Conventions

## Component APIs

- Custom Elements (Web Components) should be prefixed with `cds-`.
- There is no prefix on public custom element attributes or properties as they
  are scoped to the custom element.
- Style attributes related to sizes should use t-shirt style values. Example
  `size="sm"` ... xs, sm, md, lg, xl xxl
- Events/props should follow Angular/Vue style naming conventions of using a
  present tense verb + `change`. Example, property `open` and event `openChange`.

These component conventions allow frameworks to consume the Web easily. The convention
is also needed so extend libraries like our React wrappers `@clr/react` can parse
and set up the React version of the event. `closeChange` => `onCloseChange`.

Components primarily communicate the following ways:

```
1. properties/attrs (data in)
2. custom events (data out)
3. slots (content projection)
```

## Properties vs Attributes

Most frameworks provide a templating syntax to set JavaScript properties on a component.
Example:

```typescript
const modal = document.querySelector('cds-modal');
modal.closable = false; // setting the JavaScript object property
```

If I am using a framework like Angular I can use the template binding to
set the property.

```html
<cds-modal [closable]="booleanValue"></cds-modal>
```

Lit-element will automatically sync attributes and properties together unless
specified otherwise. While attributes are always string values in HTML, lit-element
and the `@property` decorator will attempt to convert the attribute value based
on the value type that was set on the `@property` decorator. [This includes shallow objects and arrays.](https://lit-element.polymer-project.org/guide/properties#initialize-markup)

## Example APIs

Here are some examples of what the syntax of different frameworks look like
when interacting with a Custom Element.

### Angular

Angular can set attributes or properties. To set a property use the `[prop]`]
syntax. To listen to an event use the `(event)` syntax.

```html
<!--
  - `size` is set as an HTML attribute so no binding syntax is used
  - [closable] is setting a property on the element
  - (closeChange) is listening for the `closeChange` custom event
-->
<cds-modal size="lg" [closable]="booleanValue" (closeChange)="log($event.detail)">
  <p>slot content</p>
</cds-modal>
```

### VueJS

Vue can set attributes or properties. To set a property use the `:prop` syntax.
To listen to an event use the `@event` syntax.

```html
<!--
  - `size` is set as an HTML attribute so no binding syntax is used
  - :closable is setting a property on the element
  - @closeChange is listening for the `closeChange` custom event
-->
<cds-modal size="lg" :closable="booleanValue" @closeChange="log($event.detail)">
  <p>slot content</p>
</cds-modal>
```

### React + @clr/react wrappers

<cds-alert-group status="danger" cds-layout="m-y:lg">
  <cds-alert>
    React requires use of the @clr/react package to workaround
    <a cds-text="link" href="https://custom-elements-everywhere.com/#react">
      several open issues
    </a>.
  </cds-alert>
</cds-alert-group>

```jsx
/*
  - `size` unlike the examples above `size` is set as a property
  - closable is setting a property on the element
  - onCloseChange is listening for the `closeChange` custom event
*/
<CdsModal size="lg" closable={this.state.booleanValue} onCloseChange={this.log}>
  <p>slot content</p>
</CdsModal>
```

## Public Import APIs

Public Components are exported with a side effect free file import. Public
Utilities are only exported through the top-level import path. To register a
component to use, we export a stand-alone `register.js` side effect import.

```typescript
import { CommonStrings } from '@clr/core'; // utilities
import { CdsButton } from '@clr/core/button'; // component class
import '@clr/core/button/register.js'; // register and use component
```

By keeping the component registration as a separate side effect import, we ensure
proper tree shaking at a component and symbol level. This convention also [future
proofs our API to allow our components to be aliased](https://github.com/w3c/webcomponents/issues/716).

Overall we try to avoid users from importing anything by direct file
or with deep import paths as this is reaching into the library internals, which
can change. The `@clr/core/internal` module is an internal private module for shared
utilities between components.
