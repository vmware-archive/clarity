# Stateless Components

Core components are intentionally as stateless as possible. This means components
do not maintain state but rather only render based on the information passed to
the component. Let's take a look at an example with a modal.

```html
<cds-modal>modal content</cds-modal>
```

With the modal, we want to show or hide based on some application logic. We don't
define a `show` property or a `showChange` property. The logic to determine if the
modal should show be fully controlled by the application. The application may
want to hide via CSS or completely add or remove the modal from the DOM. Because
of this, the modal by default is visible. We do not assume the state of its visibility.

Instead of defining an `open` or `show` state, we provide a `closeChange` event.
This event fires when the user has clicked the close button within the modal.
The modal itself does nothing but emit the event. The modal only notifies the
application the user had clicked the close button. We leave it to the application
to determine what it should do.

This is important as it provides a much more flexible API and prevents "escape hatch"
APIs. If we were to control the visibility of the modal, then if the application
needs to validate some logic before closing, we would have to introduce yet another
API to be able to intercept before closing. Let's take a look at how an Angular
app may use this.

```html
<cds-button (click)="showModal = true">open modal</cds-modal>
<cds-modal *ngIf="showModal" (closeChange)="closeModal($event.detail)">Some Content</cds-modal>
```

```ts
export class AppComponent {
  showModal = false;

  async closeModal(modalClosed: boolean) {
    const isValid: boolean = await someAsyncValidationCheck();

    if (valid) {
      this.showModal = false;
    } else {
      warnOfPotentialIssues();
    }
  }
}
```

Because we defer the state to the application, the developer now has the flexibility
to intercept and run additional checks before closing the modal. While this is a
subtle difference when compared to the stateful version, it provides a more
flexible component and keeps the overall public API surface small.
