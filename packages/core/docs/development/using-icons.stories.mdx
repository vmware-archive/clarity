# Internal Icon Usage

To get the optimal performance, we only import and register the icons necessary
within a given component. Consumers of Clarity Icons would use the following:

```typescript
import { ClarityIcons, successStandardIcon } from '@cds/core/icon';

ClarityIcons.addIcons(successStandardIcon);
```

The icon service and icons are all exported in the `index.ts`, the root
`@cds/core/icon` entry point. This makes it easy to use but breaks certain performance
characteristics internally. If a consumer is using a component via a CDN
importing the compiled `index.js`, the browser will resolve all imports within
that file. This means the browser will load hundreds of icons regardless of whether
the user was using an alert with one icon.

This issue is only when using native modules without a module bundler. However
to keep our components as compatible as possible with all options internally we
must use a slightly different import than our typical users.

```typescript
import { ClarityIcons } from '@cds/core/icon/icon.service.js';
import { successStandardIcon } from '@cds/core/icon/shapes/success-standard.js';
```

By importing the direct path, we bypass the `index .js` file to prevent
a large module resolution when using native ESM. This is an internal-only
optimization, and users of the icons should continue to use the root `@cds/core/icon` import.

We may be able to change this in the future, but since it's possibly a breaking
change, for now, we import explicitly.

Once imported, we must register the icon within the Constructor of the component.

```typescript
import { ClarityIcons } from '@cds/core/icon/icon.service.js';
import { successStandardIcon } from '@cds/core/icon/shapes/success-standard.js';

export class CdsMyComponent {
  constructor() {
    super();
    ClarityIcons.addIcons(successStandardIcon);
  }
}
```

If `ClarityIcons.addIcons()` is called outside the component Constructor in the
module file, it may be removed by any code tree-shaking optimizations as it is a
side effect call. By keeping it within the Constructor, we guarantee that the
icon will be added and not removed by aggressive tree shaking.
