# Alert

Alerts are banners that communicate a message with a severity attached to it. They grab the user’s attention to provide critical information needed in context.

By default, alerts outside of an alert group have a lightweight look and functionality. This means that:

- `cds-alert-actions` child components will not be displayed inside a lightweight alert
- lightweight alerts cannot display a close button – they are always considered to be `closable = false`

Lightweight alerts can be placed inside containers such cards and layouts. But if the alerts are dynamic, their container will need to have an `aria-live` attribute set on them so that screen-readers will announce content changes within the container.

Making a lightweight alert dismissible or "closable" will require the use of a `cds-inline-button` and an action on the product side that determines whether or not the alert should be removed from view.

## Installation

To use the alert component import the component in your JavaScript.

```typescript
import '@cds/core/alert/register.js';
```

```html
<!-- dynamic alerts should go inside a container with an aria-live setting. static alerts do not need this. -->
<cds-alert aria-live="polite">
  This is an alert. It will display a decorative "info" icon by default. You should set the aria-live attribute on the
  alert to a level that aligns with the severity of the alert's status.
</cds-alert>
```
