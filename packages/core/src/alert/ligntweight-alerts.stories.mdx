# Lightweight Alert

Alerts communicate a message with a severity attached to it.
They grab the userâ€™s attention to provide critical information needed in context.
Lightweight alerts can be placed inside containers such cards and layouts. But
if the alerts are dynamic, their container will need to have an `aria-live`
attribute set on them so that screen-readers will announce content changes
within the container.

Making a lightweight alert dismissible or "closable" will require the use of a
`cds-inline-button` and an action on the product side that determines whether or
not the alert should be removed from view.

## Installation

To use the alert component import the component in your JavaScript.

```typescript
import '@cds/core/alert/register.js';
```

```html
<cds-alert-group type="light">
  <cds-alert status="info">
    This is an alert. It will display a decorative "info" icon by default. You should set the aria-live attribute on the
    alert to a level that aligns with the severity of the alert's status.
  </cds-alert>
  <cds-alert status="danger">
    This is a second alert. It will display a decorative "danger" icon by default.
  </cds-alert>
</cds-alert-group>
```
