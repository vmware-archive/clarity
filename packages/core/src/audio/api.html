  Web Audio API is a DSP synth that uses oscillators to create sounds but can also play samples. Much like motion,
  I don't know if there is utility to having it exist outside a component context.

  I'd hazard that it would look something like...

  -- myComponent --
  import { successAudioTuple } from '@cds/core/audio/sounds/success.js';
  import { dingSound } from '@cds/core/audio/sounds/ding.js';
  import { CdsAudioService } from '@cds/core/internal/services/audio.js';

  CdsAudioService.add(successAudioTuple, ['my-component-alert', dingSound]);

  class MyComponet extends AudibleElement {
    @property({ type: String})
    cdsAudio = "on"; // <= this is where we could turn audio "off" or "theme" it...

    @property({ type: Object })
    cdsAudioConfig = {}; // <= exposed publically so it can be overwritten, similar to cds-i18n

    audioController = new CdsAudioController(this, this.cdsAudioConfig)
  }
