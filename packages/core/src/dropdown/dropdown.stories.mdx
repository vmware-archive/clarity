Dropdowns are a generic popup container that can be positioned on the screen. This means thay act as a container for
anytihng a consumer needs to project into them. They will position themselves relative to another element on the
page that we call the "anchor".

This dropdown component is a public alias for an internal generic popup component that implements the public API
demonstrated here. All other components that implement popup behavior will also follow this api.

## Installation

To use the dropdown component import the component in your JavaScript.

```typescript
import '@cds/core/dropdown/register.js';
```

```html
<cds-button popup="my-dropdown" id="my-button" onclick="document.getElementById('my-dropdown').hidden = false"
  >Open Dropdown</cds-button
>
<cds-dropdown anchor="my-button" id="my-dropdown" orientation="right not:top">
  <div cds-layout="vertical gap:lg p:lg align:stretch">
    <h3 cds-first-focus cds-text="section" id="basic-dropdown-title">Dropdown Title</h3>
    <p cds-text="body">Any content can be placed inside a generic dropdown.</p>
    <p cds-text="body">Here we've placed a title and text in the dropdown.</p>
    <p cds-text="body">Something should get immediate focus when the dropdown opens. Here it is the title.</p>
  </div>
</cds-dropdown>
```

## Anatomy

The dropdown consists of a number of components, some of which are optional.

- **Trigger (optional)** The trigger is an element that shows the dropdown through user interaction, like a user clicking
  a button. There is no requirement that all dropdowns have a trigger. A trigger is associated with a dropdown by passing
  the dropdown's id into the trigger's `popup` attribute. If a trigger is defined, the dropdown will manage its aria
  attributes so that screen readers will associate the trigger with the dropdown. This will help screen readers identify
  the connection between the trigger and dropdown, as well as announce when the dropdown is open.

- **Anchor:** The anchor is the element that the dropdown will be positioned against. When shown, the dropdown will appear
  above, below, or on either side of the anchor as available space allows. Most of the time, a dropdown's trigger and anchor
  will be the same element. But this does not have to be the case. An implementation may have a trigger in a navbar but want
  the dropdown to align itself below the navbar, not just the button that opened it. Likewise, a form control action may
  trigger a dropdown but have it aligned in relation to the entire form control instead of just the action so as to not
  cover up a form control's label.

- **Pointer:** Dropdowns may include an optional `<cds-internal-pointer>` element. Pointers are used to make the relationship
  between a dropdown and its anchor more explicit. There are two types of pointers included with the dropdown: a `default`
  pointer which is a small, equilateral triangle and an `angle` pointer which is a right angled triangle. The type of pointer
  is defined by passing in `type="angle"` on the `<cds-internal-pointer>` element like so...
  `<cds-internal-pointer type="angle"></cds-internal-pointer>`. If no type is passed but a pointer is present inside the
  dropdown, a `default` pointer will be used.

- **dropdown:** The dropdown itself contains content which it is given by the end user to display. A dropdown can contain
  any content.

## Interaction

A dropdown is most frequently shown by a user interacting with a trigger element. When shown, a dropdown will position itself
in relation to its anchor. The anchor may be assigned to the dropdown by passing a string element id to its `anchor` attribute
in HTML or by directly assigning an element reference to its JavaScript `anchor` property.

### Positioning

A dropdown will try to show itself in a location relative to the anchor according to the preferences defined in its
`orientation` attribute. If there is not enough space on the screen, it will intelligently attempt to position
itself however it can or fallback to _responsive mode_.

### Responsive Positioning

If there is not enough space on the screen for the dropdown to fit, it will switch to a "responsive mode". This means the
dropdown will slide in from the bottom and take the full width of the screen.

### Dismissing

As with overlays, a dropdown will emit a closeChange event when its backdrop is clicked, an optional close button is clicked,
the escape key is pressed, or when any custom interaction emits a closeChange event.

- To reveal the close button inside a dropdown, add the `closable` attribute.

### Managing Focus

An element passed into a dropdown can be given a `cds-first-focus` attribute. This will be the element that receives
immediate focus when the dropdown is opened. Additionally, a dropdown has a focus trap that prevents focus from moving
outside of the bounds of the dropdown.

### Animation

The dropdown only animates in responsive mode when it slides up from the bottom of the screen. To turn off animations,
set `cds-motion="off"` on the dropdown element.

## Orientation

Orientation preferences that can be passed to the dropdown include.

- **none:** setting `<cds-dropdown orientation="none">` will force the dropdown into responsive mode.
- **top, right, left, or bottom:** The dropdown will attempt to position itself in the cardinal directions passed to the dropdown's `orientation` attribute. The dropdown will follow the order given. So `<cds-dropdown orientation="right left top">` will try to position the dropdown to the right of the anchor first, then the left, and then above the anchor. It will only try to position below the anchor if all other positions have failed.
- **not:??** Preceding a position with `not:` will make the dropdown ignore that position. `<cds-dropdown orientation="not:top">` means the dropdown will never appear above the anchor.
- **only:??** Preceding a position with `only:` means the dropdown will only try to position the dropdown in that one position, ignoring all other positions. If it doesn't have enough space to appear in that position, it will go to responsive mode.
