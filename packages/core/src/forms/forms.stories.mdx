# Form

<cds-alert-group status="warning" cds-layout="m-b:lg">
  <cds-alert>
    This component or utility is offered as a preview. This means we are currently working on it and seeking feedback.
    Please be aware that this component or utility may have breaking changes before we finish working on it.
  </cds-alert>
</cds-alert-group>

Forms are comprised of text and input components such as checkboxes, dropdowns,
input fields, radio buttons, and toggle switches. The easier users can complete
forms, the better your response rates will typically be. Forms should be clear,
concise, and relevant to its context. Forms by default are horizontal but offer
additional layouts.

## Installation

To use the form component import the component in your JavaScript.

```typescript
import '@clr/core/forms/register.js';
```

```html
<form>
  <cds-form-group>
    <cds-input>
      <label>input</label>
      <input type="text" />
    </cds-input>

    <cds-textarea>
      <label>textarea</label>
      <textarea></textarea>
    </cds-textarea>

    <cds-button type="submit">save</cds-button>

## Internationalization

<cds-alert status="warning">RTL support is currently an experimental API</cds-alert>

RTL languages such as Arabic, Hebrew, Persian and Urdu are read and written from right-to-left.
To use RTL add the `<html dir="rtl">` to the HTML root element. Learn more at
[MDN RTL Guidelines](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Developer_guide/RTL_Guidelines).

## Fieldsets, Form Groupings, and Accessibility

<cds-alert status="danger">Use of the `fieldset` and `legend` HTML elements inside a form group is discouraged.</cds-alert>

The use of the `fieldset` HTML element and its corresponding `legend` element inside a `cds-form-group` component or inside another element using the `cds-layout` attribute is not recommended.

The `fieldset` element responds erratically to flex and grid CSS layouts. This is a browser rendering issue and not an issue in Clarity.

A recommended workaround is to use the `group` aria role and associate an `aria-labelledby` value with an existing header in the form group.

An example of how this would work <a href="iframe.html?id=forms-preview-forms-stories--checkout-form&amp%3BviewMode=story&viewMode=story" target="_blank">
can be found in this example form</a>.
