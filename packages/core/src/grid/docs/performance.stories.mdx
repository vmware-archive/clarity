The Core Data Grid performance primarily relies on two points, how much data and cell content.
When rendering a Data Grid and working with a large data set, leverage pagination and conditionally
render only the visible rows in the DOM. This ensures the browser only needs to render rows as needed.
Be aware of what content is placed within rows and cells. The more components or
more complex the content, the more work it will take the browser to render that content.

Because the browser will render only rows that are placed in the DOM you can leverage
application framework optimizations for rendering performance. For example, if using Angular,
take advantage of the [ngFor trackBy](https://angular.io/api/common/NgForOf) functionality.

To optimize render performance, the `cds-grid-row` leverages the [CSS Contain Visibility](https://web.dev/content-visibility/) property.
This enables the browser to skip expensive render calculations by providing an intrisic height.
By default, the height of the row is set for you. However, if your grid changes the default height, then
apply the `--row-height` property to the grid to get better overall rendering performance.

```html
<!-- if custom row height -->
<cds-grid style="--row-height: 60px"> </cds-grid>
```
