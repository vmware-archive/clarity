# Popup

The popup is an internal component that forms the foundation of the dropdown, sign post, and dropdown menu. The
popup can be used to create your own custom components that position themselves on the screen relative to another
element.

## Anatomy

The popup and, by extension, all of its sub-classes share a number of common components.

- **Trigger:** The trigger is an element that initiates showing the popup. The trigger element is optional. There
  is no requirement that all popups have a trigger. Typically, a trigger element is something like a button that
  opens a drop-down or a form control action button that reveals a list of potential options. A trigger is associated
  with a popup by passing the popup's id into the trigger's `popup` attribute. If a trigger is defined, the popup will
  manage its aria attributes so that screen readers will associate the trigger with the popup.

- **Anchor:** The anchor is the element that the popup will be aligned against. When shown, the popup will appear
  above, below, or on either side of the anchor as space on the screen allows. A popup's trigger and anchor will
  often be the same element. But this is not always the case. A popup may have a trigger in the navbar but need to
  align itself below the navbar, not below the button that opened it. Likewise, a form control action may trigger a
  popup but need to have the popup aligned in relation to the form control block instead of the action button so as
  to not cover up the form control's label.

- **Pointer:** Popups can include an optional `<cds-internal-pointer>` element. Pointers are used to make the
  connection between a popup and its anchor more explicit.

- **Popup:** The popup itself is a generic container for content. A popup can contain any content.

## Interaction

A popup is shown most often by a user interacting with a trigger element like a button. When shown, a popup will
smartly position itself in relation to its anchor. The anchor may be assigned to the popup by passing a string
element id to its `anchor` attribute in the HTML or by directly assigning an element reference to its JavaScript
`anchor` property.

### Positioning

A popup will try to show itself in a location relative to the anchor according to the preferences defined in its
`orientation` attribute. If there is not enough space on the screen, it will intelligently attempt to position
itself however it can or fallback to _responsive mode_.

### Responsive Positioning

If there is not enough space on the screen for the popup to fit, it will switch to a "responsive mode". This means
the popup will slide in from the bottom and take the full width of the screen.

### Dismissing

As with overlays, a popup will emit a closeChange event when its backdrop is clicked, an optional close button is
clicked, the escape key is pressed, or when any custom interaction emits a closeChange event.

### Managing Focus

As with overlays, an element inside the popup can be given the `cds-first-focus` attribute. This will become the
element that receives immediate focus when the popup is opened.

Accessibility recommends defining a "first focus" element.

Additionally, a popup has a focus trap that prevents focus from moving outside of the bounds of the popup while it
is active. Note that if the element assigned first focus is not a natively focusable element, the element will
receive focus but will not be in the tab flow of focusable elements inside the popup's focus trap. This behavior is
a requirement from the accessibility that works with Clarity.

### Animation

The popup only animates in responsive mode when it slides up from the bottom of the screen. To turn off animations,
set `cds-motion="off"` on the popup element.

## Installation

To use the internal component add the register import to the `register.ts` of
the consuming component.

```typescript
import '@cds/core/internal-components/popup/register.js';
```

```html
<cds-internal-popup>
  <div>
    <h3 cds-text="section" cds-first-focus>I am a popup</h3>
    <p cds-text="body">Hello, I am a popup. You can put whatever content you want in me.</p>
  </div>
</cds-internal-popup>
```
