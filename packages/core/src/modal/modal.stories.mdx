# Modal

Modals provide information or help a user complete a task. They require the user to take an action to dismiss them.

## Installation

To use the modal component import the component in your JavaScript.

```typescript
import '@cds/core/modal/register.js';
```

```html
<cds-modal>
  <cds-modal-header>
    <h3 cds-text="title">I have a nice title</h3>
  </cds-modal-header>
  <cds-modal-content>
    <p cds-text="body">But not much to say...</p>

## Scrolling Modal Content

Having a modal content area that scrolls is not recommended. Teams should do their best to ensure that their modal is
large enough accommodate the content within it. Scrolling content areas in modals may present accessibility challenges
for screen readers.

If scrolling content cannot be avoided in a modal, the accessibility team recommends that form fields be placed at the
bottom of the content area. This helps to mitigate an issue in NVDA where screen reader users are placed into a "forms
mode" and may not be aware that there is content below the form.
