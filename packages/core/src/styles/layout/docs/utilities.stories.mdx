# Utilities

Outside of the horizontal, vertical, and grid layout types the `cds-layout`
system provides additional utilities for managing visibility and centering.

## Display

The display option allows us to change the visibility of an element based on the
Clarity Design size breakpoint tokens.

## Screen Reader Only

For Accessibility, sometimes you need to hide content and only make it discoverable
for screen readers. To do this you can use the `display:screen-reader-only` utility.

## Containers

The Container utility makes it easy to limit and center content within a layout.
This is useful for linear content layouts.
