# Spacing

<cds-alert-group status="warning" cds-layout="m-b:lg">
  <cds-alert>
    This component or utility is offered as a preview. This means we are currently working on it and seeking feedback.
    Please be aware that this component or utility may have breaking changes before we finish working on it.
  </cds-alert>
</cds-alert-group>

Spacing is managed by two sets of spacing tokens. One set for managing space
within components and another for managing page level layout space.

## Installation

To use the spacing utils import the global CSS.

```scss
// import into sass or css
@import '~@clr/core/global.min';

// or import in html
<link href="/node_modules/@clr/core/global.min.css" rel="stylesheet">
```

## Layout Spacing

The layout space tokens are used with the [layout system](.?path=/docs/experimental-layout-get-started--page)
and provide a larger value set for page level layouts. This allows content
density to be controlled consistently.

## Spacing

The space tokens provide a set of smaller values used for adjusting
space between elements within a component. These values allow
more control for detailed alignments within a component and are used
within Clarity components.

```css
.my-element {
  padding: var(--cds-token-space-3);
}
```

<Story id="foundation-design-tokens-stories--space" />
