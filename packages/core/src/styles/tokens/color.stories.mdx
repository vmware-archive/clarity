# Color

Clarity provides several color options when building your applications. The global
palette provides a large selection of Clarity themed colors. The alias tokens provides
a set of semantic purpose defined tokens for different UI interactions and states.

## Status

Status colors provide a palette of colors for conveying status information. Our
status colors consist of info (default), warning, danger, and success. There are
two sets of status colors, primary and secondary statuses.

Primary statuses are used for interactions that should be the users primary
attention (button, banner alerts). Secondary statuses are secondary interactions
and do not draw as much attention visually (outline button, tag, lighweight alerts).
