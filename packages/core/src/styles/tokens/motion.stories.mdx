# Motion

Clarity provides several options for customizing animations when building your applications. In the global space, Clarity has a number of animation timing and easing options while still allowing timing and easing customizations at the component level through CSS custom properties like `--animation-duration` and `--animation-easing`.

## Duration

The duration of an animation determines how long the animation runs from start to finish. Setting an animation duration to zero or `0s` has the same effect as turning an animation off.

## Easing

Easing provides a timing "curve" to change how the animation runs. The effect is to make animations seem snappier, more prolonged, or more natural.

## Motion and Clarity Components

There are several Clarity components that use Clarity Motion's property-driven, transition-focused animations. Components like modals and accordions ship with built in animations. From the standpoint of a product using Clarity components, animations can be turned "on" or "off" by setting the `cds-motion` attribute on the component as demonstrated in the example below.

More advanced configuration and customization is possible through the [internal Clarity Motion utilities and services](./?path=/story/internal-apis-motion-getting-started--page).
