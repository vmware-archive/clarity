# Object Styles

Object style tokens are token values that construct most components in Clarity.
These values define common background colors, borders, shadows and containers.

## Object Border Width

Border width are controlled by a scale of four values. Each increasing width.

## Object Border Radius

Border radius values in Clarity fall under three values. Most container style elements
have the default `0.15rem` while interaction elements such as tags have a higher
radius with `0.6rem`. The third token is for elements which are full circles such
as the `cds-badge` component.

## Object Border Color

All border colors fall under three values. Most container elements default to the
default border color tokens and may adjust tint or shade dependent on the usage.

## Object Opacity

Object opacity colors can be used to define overlay background on elements. Do
not use opacity as text color values as it can cause accessibility contrast issues.

## Shadow

Shadows provide depth and layering to an application. Clarity has three shadow layers
to choose from. Shadows become lighter as the element using them is elevated. Example,
inline components like cards would use `shadow-100` while mid elevation components
like datepickers, dropdowns, and popovers use `shadow-200`. Components such as
the modal and wizard at the highest elevation level use `shadow-300`.

## Object Container Backgrounds

Objects can have different background colors to differentiate the layers or state of
a particular container.

## Object Layers

Object layers define visual boundaries between content. Clarity consists of three
layer types.

- **App**: (body) default background of an applicaiton
- **Container**: most components to contrast to the base background (cards, dropdowns, accordion)
- **Overlay**: elements which define full screen overlays (modals, wizards)

## Custom Object Demo

By using provided object tokens and aliases we can build custom components that
have the look and feel of Clarity while automatically staying in sync with dark theme.
Use the **Themes** switcher in the top navigation to toggle the current theme.
