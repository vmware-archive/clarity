The Clarity Core Typography System provides a flexible API to apply typography
styles explicitly to elements. This gives full control of the visual styling of
an element separate from the HTML semantics.

## Installation

To use the typography system import the global CSS.

```scss
// import into sass or css
@import '~@clr/core/global.min';

// or import in html
<link href="/node_modules/@clr/core/global.min.css" rel="stylesheet">
```

## Usage

The following examples present Clarity typography in a semantic and use-based format.
Instead of h0 or h4, we reference `display` or `section`. The benefits of this approach
are de-coupling the display of textual content from the HTML semantics. This gives
developers more latitude in creating semantically correct HTML documents while also
being empowered to deliver to designer specs. Another benefit is limiting the
variations of textual styles, making it easier for designers and developers to
create consistent and coherent experiences.
