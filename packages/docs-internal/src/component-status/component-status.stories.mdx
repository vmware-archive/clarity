# Component Status

Badges provide a method to highlight a count of an element either next to it
or inside the element itself.

## Installation

To use the counter component, import the component in your JavaScript.

```typescript
import 'lib/component-status/register.js';
```

The minimal example of the counter component is shown below. You need at least one attribute and this is `name`,
the other one `description` is optional in the case that you need to overwrite the default description block.

Important note here is that this component depends to internal private service named `ComponentInformation.service`.
This service is used to get the information about the component and there meta information.

```html
<doc-component-status name="accordion"></doc-component-status>
```

## Component Status
