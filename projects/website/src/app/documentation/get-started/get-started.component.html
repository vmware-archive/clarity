  <h1 id="introduction" clrFocusOnViewInit>Get started with Clarity Design System</h1>
  <p>
    Project Clarity is an open source design system that brings together UX guidelines, an HTML/CSS framework, and
    Angular components. Clarity is for both designers and developers.
  </p>
  <p>
    Clarity’s designs stem from continuous exploration and research. These designs are built into our HTML/CSS
    components, which can be used any web UI, regardless of the underlying JavaScript framework. Clarity also offers a
    set of well-designed and implemented data-bound components built on top of Angular, one of the most popular
    JavaScript frameworks in the industry.
  </p>
  <h2 id="howToUse">How to Use Clarity</h2>
  <p>
    We offer three approaches for utilizing Clarity: just the UX guidelines, UX guidelines and our HTML/CSS framework,
    or put everything together with our Angular implementation.
  </p>

  <h3 id="designResources">Using Clarity Design Resources</h3>
  <p>
    Jumpstart your project with one of our Sketch or Figma-based design resources. Start by downloading the
    <a href="https://github.com/vmware/clarity/files/5425574/Metropolis.zip" target="_blank">Metropolis fonts</a>. Then
    download your resources of choice. We recommend that with your UI Library selection, that you also select the
    matching Icon Library as the two work together.
  </p>

  <h3 id="uiInstallation">HTML/CSS Framework</h3>
  <p>
    If you just want to use our HTML/CSS implementations, you need to get the latest code from NPM and then add the
    assets to your project.
  </p>
  <p><clr-code-snippet [clrCode]="'npm install @clr/ui --save'"></clr-code-snippet></p>
  <p>
    You'll need to include one of the files found at
    <code class="clr-code">node_modules/@clr/ui/clr-ui.min.css</code> for the normal theme or
    <code class="clr-code">node_modules/@clr/ui/clr-ui-dark.min.css</code> for the dark theme into your build tooling.
  </p>
  <p>
    You can also load this CSS file from a CDN like you see below. See <a href="https://unpkg.com/#/">unpkg.com</a> for
    more details.
  </p>
  <p><clr-code-snippet [clrCode]="uiCdn" clrLanguage="html"></clr-code-snippet></p>

  <h3 id="angularCLI">Angular Option 1: Installing using Angular CLI (Recommended)</h3>
  <p>
    For any Angular application, which uses the CLI v6 or greater, we recommend using the
    <code class="clr-code">ng add</code> feature of the CLI to install Clarity for you. This works regardless if you
    have a brand new application, or one that you've been working on for some time, just as long as you have Angular 6
    setup.
  </p>
  <div class="alert alert-info">
    <div class="alert-items">
      <div class="alert-item static">
        <div class="alert-icon-wrapper">
          <clr-icon class="alert-icon" shape="info-circle"></clr-icon>
        </div>
        <span class="alert-text"
          >We highly recommend that all Angular projects use the CLI, because we'll also work on supporting migration
          features which will make it easier to keep Clarity and Angular up to date.</span
        >
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p></p>
  <ol class="list">
    <li>
      Generate a new Angular application (if you haven't already):
      <clr-code-snippet [clrCode]="'ng new my-app'"></clr-code-snippet>
    </li>
    <li>
      Navigate to the directory:
      <clr-code-snippet [clrCode]="'cd my-app'"></clr-code-snippet>
    </li>
    <li>
      Run the ng add command for Clarity:
      <clr-code-snippet [clrCode]="'ng add @clr/angular'"></clr-code-snippet>
    </li>
  </ol>
  <p></p>
  <p>
    If you are using the Angular CLI with multiple projects, you can specify which project to add Clarity to by using
    the <code class="clr-code">--project PROJECTNAME</code> flag.
  </p>
  <p></p>

  <h3 id="seedProjectAngular">Angular Option 2: Manually adding Clarity to an Angular project</h3>
  <p>You can build an Angular app, then install Clarity onto your project.</p>
  <h4 id="step-1-build-an-angular-2-app">Step 1: Build an Angular App</h4>
  <p>
    Create a new Angular application, if you need a quickstart use
    <a href="https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/quickstart.html">the 5 Min Quickstart</a>.
  </p>
  <h4 id="installing">Step 2: Install Clarity packages</h4>
  <p>Clarity is published as three separate packages on NPM, as well as one dependency.</p>
  <p>
    <a id="clarity_icons"></a>
  </p>
  <ul class="list">
    <li>
      <b>@clr/core.</b> The library of web components and foundational pieces also used in Angular components. Available
      starting version 3.0.
    </li>
    <li><b>@clr/icons.</b> The library that provides the custom element icons.</li>
    <li><b>@clr/ui.</b> Contains the static styles for building HTML components.</li>
    <li><b>@clr/angular.</b> Contains the Angular components. This package depends on @clr/ui for styles.</li>
    <li>
      <b>@webcomponents/webcomponentsjs.</b> A polyfill for webcomponents for older browsers, which Clarity depends
      upon.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>Install them all by running the following command with NPM.</p>
  <p>
    <clr-code-snippet
      clrLanguage="bash"
      [clrCode]="'npm install @clr/core @clr/icons @clr/angular @clr/ui @webcomponents/webcomponentsjs --save'"
    ></clr-code-snippet>
  </p>

  <h5 id="step-3-scripts-styles">Step 3: Adding scripts and styles</h5>
  <p>If you are using the Angular CLI, you need to add the <code class="clr-code">angular.json</code> file.</p>
  <p>
    Find the <code class="clr-code">scripts</code> and <code class="clr-code">styles</code> arrays and add the
    following: <clr-code-snippet clrLanguage="javascript" [clrCode]="nodeImports"></clr-code-snippet>
  </p>
  <p></p>
  <p>
    If you are not using the CLI, you'll need to add the files listed above to your build tooling or you could also put
    them in the head of the index.html file like:
    <clr-code-snippet clrLanguage="html" [clrCode]="htmlImports"></clr-code-snippet>
  </p>
  <p></p>

  <h5 id="step-4-install-clarity-angular">Step 4: Add Clarity to Angular application</h5>
  <p>
    Import the ClarityModule into your Angular application's module. Some features also depend upon the
    <code class="clr-code">BrowserAnimationsModule</code>, so you should add it as well. Your application's main module
    might look like this:
    <clr-code-snippet [clrCode]="ngModuleExample" [clrLanguage]="'typescript'"></clr-code-snippet>
  </p>

  <h4 id="step-5-run-your-app">Step 5: Run Your App</h4>
  <clr-code-snippet clrLanguage="bash" [clrCode]="'npm start'"></clr-code-snippet>
  <h4 id="step6-update">Step 6: Update Clarity</h4>
  <p>
    In order to keep up with Clarity, you can use ng update to automatically update Clarity to the latest version in
    your Angular project. This will also run any migration schematics, which can update code for you or warn you about
    changes in Clarity that affect your application. It usually helps to update Angular first, then Clarity.
  </p>
  <clr-code-snippet
    clrLanguage="bash"
    [clrCode]="'ng update @angular/core @angular/cli
ng update @clr/angular'"
  ></clr-code-snippet>
  <p>If you want to update to a prerelease version, you can do so by running:</p>
  <clr-code-snippet
    clrLanguage="bash"
    [clrCode]="'ng update @angular/core@next @angular/cli@next
ng update @clr/angular@next'"
  ></clr-code-snippet>

  </p>
  <h2>Screen Reader Support</h2>
  <p class="bump-down">
    Clarity is tested across several sets of screen reader and browser combinations against the WCAG 2.1 spec. The
    testing has identified the two combinations that enable us to provide support when fixing issues related to the
    various assistive technologies available to users. The following are the primary combinations that we focus on when
    addressing issues on the Windows and macOS platforms:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>NVDA + Firefox (Windows)</li>
    <li>VoiceOver + Safari (Apple)</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    <em>
      The latest version of both screen reader and browser is used when testing issues and WCAG 2.1 compliance.
