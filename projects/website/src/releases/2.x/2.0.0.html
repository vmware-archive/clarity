      Welcome to Clarity 2.0! We've worked hard to get to this major milestone, and are excited about the future of
      Clarity! All new features, additions, deprecations and bug-fixes are listed below for an easy summarization of
      what changed between 1.0 and 2.0.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is the second release to follow the support policy. It follows the Angular LTS support policy as is outlined
      in the blog post
      <a href="https://medium.com/claritydesignsystem/updating-the-clarity-release-and-support-strategy-c1e37f7d5a0"
        >here</a
      >.
    </p>
    <p>There are a few things Clarity consumers should take note of:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        We are starting LTS (Long Term Support) for Clarity v1.x and will only be adding security and severe bugfixes
        during this period
      </li>
      <li>We are no longer supporting Clarity v0.13.x with security and severe bugfixes</li>
      <li>
        This begins the active development period for Clarity v2.x and we will be adding new features
        <strong>that are not breaking changes</strong> during this period
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      To get this update, run <code class="clr-code">ng update @clr/angular</code>. You can use this with any Angular
      CLI project, even if you've already started to work on it. You may need to run
      <code class="clr-code">ng update @angular/core @angular/cli</code> first to update to Angular 8.
    </p>

    <h6 new-component>
      Added Vertical Tabs (<a href="https://github.com/vmware/clarity/pull/3102" target="_blank">#3102</a>)
    </h6>
    <p>
      The addition of vertical tabs now allows consumers to specify
      <code class="clr-code">clrLayout ="vertical"</code> on a <code class="clr-code">clr-tabs container</code>. Please
      refer to the updated <a routerLink="/documentation/tabs">documentation</a> for more info.
    </p>
    <h6 new-component>
      New Accordion Component (<a href="https://github.com/vmware/clarity/pull/3378" target="_blank">#3378</a>)
    </h6>
    <p>
      Accordions are designed for use in the main content area. They allow generic content to be collapsed. Users are
      able to expand to show more detail. For more details and code examples check out the documentation page
      <a routerLink="/documentation/accordion">here</a>.
    </p>
    <h6 new-component>
      New Stepper Component (<a href="https://github.com/vmware/clarity/pull/3378" target="_blank">#3378</a>)
    </h6>
    <p>
      A stepper structures multi-step processes into 2 or more expanding panels that break up complex workflows. Under
      the hood, the stepper is a specialized Accordion. To understand the difference and see examples of code in use
      check out the documentation <a routerLink="/documentation/stepper">here</a>.

        target="_blank"
        >#3283</a
      >)
    </h6>
    <p>
      Dropdown components now support keyboard interactions as part of these accessibility improvements. The

      <strong>accessibility</strong> section containing the details.

    <h6 breaking-change>

        >#3131</a
      >)
    </h6>
    <p>
      We've cleaned up a lot of variables and simplified the CSS theming to make it easier to work with. Custom themes
      may need to review their themes for any referenced maps and some new variables were added to capture some missing
      configurations.
    </p>
