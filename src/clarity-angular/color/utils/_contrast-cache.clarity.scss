// using cache for contrast lookup shaved 7 seconds off sass build. over 50% at this time.
// using interpolation for cacheContrast keys increased build time almost 250%.

// this cache is not exactly what the color code would pass; minor liberties were taken to apply design sense to
// the cached colors returned. what you will get is, at least, an acceptable color contrast with a color that
// returns as inoffensive. if you get funky with the colors you're trying to contrast with, you're at the mercy
// of the contrast checker. if you go around the contrast checker, well... why are you reading this?

// WCAG AA ratios represented by mapped values:
// low = 3.00 and up (applicable to very large text, bolded normal-size text, or a combination of the two)
// default = 4.5 and up (applicable to normal-sized text that is not bolded or large text that is thin)
// high = 7 and up (applicable to normal-sized text that is thin or small, normal weight text)
// superHigh = 13 and up (applicable to very small, normal weight text or small, thin text)
