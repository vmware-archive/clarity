        <h4>Revolver (1966)</h4>
        <p>
            Revolver is the seventh studio album by the English rock band the Beatles. 
            It was released on 5 August 1966 in the United Kingdom and three days 
            later in the United States. The record spent 34 weeks on the UK Albums 
            Chart, for seven of which it held the number one spot. Reduced to eleven 
            songs for the North American market, Revolver was the last Beatles album
            to be subjected to Capitol Records' policy of altering the band's 
            intended running order and content. In America, the album topped
            the Billboard Top LPs list for six weeks.
