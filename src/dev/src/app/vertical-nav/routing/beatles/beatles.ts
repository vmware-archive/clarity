        <h4>Beatles</h4>
        <p>
            The Beatles were an English rock band formed in Liverpool in 1960. With members John Lennon, Paul McCartney,
            George Harrison and Ringo Starr, they became widely regarded as the foremost and most influential act of the
            rock era. Rooted in skiffle, beat and 1950s rock and roll, the Beatles later experimented with several
            musical styles, ranging from pop ballads and Indian music to psychedelia and hard rock, often incorporating
            classical elements and unconventional recording techniques in innovative ways. In 1963 their enormous
            popularity first emerged as "Beatlemania", and as the group's music grew in sophistication in subsequent
            years, led by primary songwriters Lennon and McCartney, they came to be perceived as an embodiment of the
            ideals shared by the counterculture of the 1960s.
