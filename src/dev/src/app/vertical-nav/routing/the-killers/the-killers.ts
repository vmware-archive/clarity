        <h4>The Killers</h4>
        <p>
            The Killers are an American rock band formed in Las Vegas, Nevada, in 2001 by members Brandon Flowers (lead
            vocals, keyboards, bass) and Dave Keuning (guitar, backing vocals), Mark Stoermer (bass, guitar, backing
            vocals) and Ronnie Vannucci, Jr. (drums, percussion) would complete the current line-up of the band in
            2002. The band's name is derived from a logo on the bass drum of a fictitious band, portrayed in the
            music video for the New Order song "Crystal".
