            <h1>Code Highlight Examples</h1>
            <p>There are two ways demonstrated here, but they are functionally the same. The challenge with using Prism
                is that it is executed on load, which is outside of Angular rendering. Therefore, we need to manually
                trigger a call to Prism using the CodeHighlight.redraw() method.</p>
            <p>The first is to just use the component directly, and then in the containing component you'll need to get
                a reference to the code snippet (through a ViewChild, ViewChildren, or template reference), and then
                call the redraw() method AfterContentInit. This is demonstrated in the AppComponent.</p>
            <p>Alternatively, the CodeSnippetComponent encapsulates this issue into another component for easier
                consumption. This does the same thing fundamentally, but makes it reusable and doesn't pollute the
                parent component.</p>
