        <h4>Abbey Road (1969)</h4>
        <p>
            Abbey Road is the eleventh studio album by the English rock band 
            the Beatles, released on 26 September 1969 by Apple Records. 
            The recording sessions for the album were the last in which all 
            four Beatles participated. Although Let It Be was the final album 
            that the Beatles completed before the band's dissolution in April 1970, 
            most of the album had been recorded before the Abbey Road sessions began.
            A double A-side single from the album, "Something"/"Come Together", 
            released in October, topped the Billboard chart in the US.
