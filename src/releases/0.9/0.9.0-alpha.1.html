        <h6>Clarity wizard refactor/rewrite</h6>
        <p>
            0.9.0 will include the new and improved wizard component for
            Clarity Angular. This wizard component has been rebuilt from
            the ground with an eye towards preserving as much of the old
            API as possible to limit breaking changes, learning curves,
            and migration complexity.
        </p>
        <p>
            The 0.9.0-alpha release gives our users a preview of the new
            wizard so they can gauge the impact of the changes on their
            applications.
        </p>

        <p>&nbsp;</p>

        <h6>Migrating from the old to the new wizard</h6>
        <p>
            Moving from a 0.8 wizard to a 0.9 wizard involves a few minor
            steps in the host componentâ€™s HTML. For the most basic
            implementations, this should be all that is required.
        </p>
        <p>
            Advanced implementations of the 0.8 wizard may be impacted by
            the deprecations and breaking changes listed below. Please
            examine your own code for impact.
        </p>

        <p><b>Migration steps</b></p>

        <ul class="list">
            <li>
                The wizard title previously placed inside a <code
                class="clr-code">div.wizard-title</code> element must now
                be placed within a <code class="clr-code">clr-wizard-title</code>
                element. This is a straight replace that requires no
                additional code.
            </li>
            <li>
                Each wizard must now contain a set of <code
                class="clr-code">clr-wizard-button</code> elements as a direct child
                of the <code class="clr-code">clr-wizard</code> element that offers 
                four buttons of the following types: cancel, previous, next, and
                finish. This set constitutes the default button set that will be
                used by each page in the wizard if they're not overridden at the
                page level.
            </li>
            <li>
                Each wizard page must contain a <code
                class="clr-code">&lt;template pageTitle&gt;</code> element. This
                element serves as both the page title as well as the text of the
                nav element associated with the page. Optionally, a
                <code class="clr-code">&lt;template pageNavTitle&gt;</code> element
                can be included to give alternate nav text if the page title
                is too long. If your 0.8 wizard has a <code
                class="clr-code">clr-wizard-step</code> title that is different
                from your page title, then you should probably move the text in
                your <code class="clr-code">clr-wizard-step</code> to a
                <code class="clr-code">&lt;template pageNavTitle&gt;</code> element
                inside your <code class="clr-code">clr-wizard-page</code>.
            </li>
            <li>
                <code class="clr-code">clr-wizard-step</code> elements are no longer
                needed and should be removed.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p><b>0.8 wizard (before)</b></p>

        Content for step 3
    &lt;/clr-wizard-page&gt;
&lt;/clr-wizard&gt;
</code></pre>

        <p>&nbsp;</p>

        <h6>Benefits of the new wizard</h6>
        <p>
            The new wizard offers several immediate benefits compared
            to the 0.8 wizard.
        </p>

        <ul class="list">
            <li>
                Now that users can define their own button sets, the
                text inside of the buttons can say anything users
                need them to say.
            </li>
            <li>
                Because the text of our buttons is no longer hardcoded
                inside the component code, button text can be localized
                in your applications.
            </li>
            <li>
                Previously the title of a <code 
                class="clr-code">clr-wizard-page</code> relied on a very
                specific and non-intuitive DOM and classname combination.
                Wrapping this into a <code class="clr-code">&lt;template
                pageTitle&gt;</code> makes it easier
                to manage your DOM structure and also allows one element
                to reflect both the page title and the title in the nav.
            </li>
            <li>
                The 0.8 wizard required that the <code
                class="clr-code">clr-wizard-step</code> elements be outside
                of the <code class="clr-code">clr-wizard-page</code> elements.
                This meant that the order of your pages and nav elements was
                dependent upon their order inside the wizard. It also introduced
                a disconnect between the two which could easily lead to one or
                the other being presented out of order. The new wizard wraps titles
                inside of <code class="clr-code">clr-wizard-page</code>
                components, meaning all information about the pages is
                encapsulated inside the host component.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p>&nbsp;</p>

        <h6>Using the old wizard in 0.9.0-alpha</h6>
        <p>
             If you need time to update your old wizards to the new 0.9.0 wizards, 
             Clarity's 0.9.0-alpha release has you covered. All you need to do is 
             take your old wizard declarations for wizards and pages and change them
             to <code class="clr-code">clr-wizard-deprecated</code> and
             <code class="clr-code">clr-wizard-page-deprecated</code>.
        </p>
        <p>
             The objects/classes have likewise been named to <code
             class="clr-code">WizardDeprecated</code> and <code
             class="clr-code">WizardPageDeprecated</code>, in the event your TypeScript
             build or UMD complains.
        </p>
        <p>
             No other changes are necessary to keep your old wizards in 0.9.0-alpha.
        </p>
        <p>
             But note that we are planning to completely remove the old wizards when
             0.9.0 is officially released.
        </p>

<h2>Breaking changes</h2>
<ul class="list-unstyled whats-new-highlights">
    <li breaking-change>
        <h6>wizard.selectTab() has been removed</h6>
        <p>
             Depending on your use case, <code
             class="clr-code">wizard.goTo(pageId)</code> or <code
             class="clr-code">wizard.navService.setCurrentPage(pageObj)</code>
             is preferred.
        </p>
        <p>
            <code class="clr-code">goTo(pageId)</code> checks if navigation is
            allowed, based on the state of prior pages. <code
            class="clr-code">wizard.navService.setCurrentPage(pageObj)</code>
            just performs navigation.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li breaking-change>
        <h6>wizard.skipTab() and wizard.unskipTab() have been removed</h6>
        <p>
             You can now hide and show pages in the wizard  by using <code
             class="clr-code">*ngIf</code> on your <code
             class="clr-code">clr-wizard-page</code> elements.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li breaking-change>
        <h6>wizard.wizardStepChildren has been removed</h6>
        <p>
             The <code class="clr-code">wizardStepChildren</code> QueryList
             is no longer necessary. You can update, hide, and manage the state
             of your nav elements by navigating through and manipulating your pages.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li breaking-change>
        <h6>wizard.wizardPageChildren has been renamed</h6>
        <p>
             The <code class="clr-code">wizardPageChildren</code> QueryList
             is now just <code class="clr-code">wizard.pages</code>.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li breaking-change>
        <h6>The clrWizardPageErrorFlag input has been removed</h6>
        <p>
             The <code class="clr-code">clrWizardPageErrorFlag</code> input has been removed.
             The previous implementation offered no functional advantages over
             handling valid page state within a host component.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li breaking-change>
        <h6>clrWizardPageIsSkipped has been removed</h6>
        <p>
             The <code class="clr-code">clrWizardPageIsSkipped</code> input has
             been removed in favor of the use of <code class="clr-code">ngIf</code>
             to hide and show pages.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li breaking-change>
        <h6>clrWizardPageHiddenChange and clrWizardPageSkippedChange have been removed</h6>
        <p>
             The <code class="clr-code">clrWizardPageSkippedChange</code>  and <code
             class="clr-code">clrWizardPageHiddenChange</code>  outputs have been removed
             now that the improved DOM structure allows for encapsulation and the use of
             <code class="clr-code">ngIf</code> to hide and show both pages and  nav elements
             together.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li breaking-change>
        <h6>The clr-wizard-step component has been removed</h6>
        <p>
            The wizard now handles its own stepnav items. There should be no need for users
            to add or programmatically manipulate them outside of what they can do by
            navigation or programmatically manipulating a wizard page.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li breaking-change>
        <code class="clr-code">clrWizardOpenChanged</code> output has
        been changed to <code class="clr-code">clrWizardOpenChange</code> to
        better support Angular's expectations with two-way binding.
    </li>
    <li breaking-change>
        <code class="clr-code">clrWizardPageNextDisabledChanged</code> output has
        been changed to <code class="clr-code">clrWizardPageNextDisabledChange</code> to
        better support Angular's expectations with two-way binding.
    </li>
</ul>

<h2>Other Breaking Changes</h2>
<ul>
    <li breaking-change>wizard.id has been removed</li>
    <li breaking-change>WizardPage.title is now a TemplateRef and not a string</li>
    <li breaking-change>WizardPage.hasProjectedTitleContent was removed because it was no
        longer needed</li>
</ul>

<h2>Deprecations</h2>
<ul>
    <li>
        The <code class="clr-code">wizard.prev()</code> convenience function
        has been deprecated. We recommend that the <code
        class="clr-code">wizard.previous()</code> be used instead. <code
        class="clr-code">wizard.prev()</code> still works with the 0.9.0 wizard,
        however. But support for it will be dropped in the future.
    </li>
</ul>

<h2>Known Issues</h2>
<p>The alpha version of the wizard has several known issues including:</p>
<ul>
    <li>IE10 browser support</li>
    <li>
        The page collection properly syncing up after pages have been added to
        or removed from the wizard with ngIf
    </li>
    <li>
        And unpredictable conflict when there is an alt-cancel routine at
        the wizard and page level.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>
    Please keep an eye on the 
    <a href="https://github.com/vmware/clarity/issues/156">github issue</a> and
    <a href="https://github.com/vmware/clarity/pull/657">pull request</a> for
    updates and progress reports.
</p>

<h2>New Features</h2>
<p>
    The new wizard  arrives with  improved capabilities and new functionality.
    While we are committed to providing as much documentation as we can, there is
    no way that we could document all the features of the new wizard before the 0.9.0
    release.
</p>
<p>
     For undocumented features and for all features throughout 0.9.0-alpha,
     the best source of truth is the demo app within
     the Clarity sourcecode. All new features are presented there for the time being
     with demonstrations highlighting their use.
</p>
<p>
      A quick rundown of features in the new wizard follows:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        A cornucopia of inputs, outputs, services, and convenience functions all accessible
        to anyone adding a templateRef onto their <code class="clr-code">clr-wizard</code>
        declaration.
    </li>
    <li>
         Button group overrides at the page level.
    </li>
    <li>
         Custom buttons that can be assigned any action or routine.
    </li>
    <li>
         Header actions in the title bar of the wizard.
    </li>
    <li>
         A high-level way to subvert all wizard actions, allowing users to create their own
         previous, next, finish, and cancel routines.
    </li>
    <li>
        Reset functionality that can reset the navigation of the wizard to a pristine state.
    </li>
    <li>
        A number of different navigational functions.
    </li>
    <li>
        "Ghost pages" as in the initial design spec.
    </li>
    <li>
        A static/inline version of the wizard.
    </li>
</ul>

<p>
    Header actions and ghost pages are two features with known issues that may not be resolved
    before 0.9.0 is finalized. Please consider those features experimental at this time.
</p>
