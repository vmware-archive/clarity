        <div >
            <h3 id="design-guidelines">Internal language strings</h3>

            <p>Clarity has a short list of text strings that it uses internally for things such as icon alt text or button text. When possible, Clarity avoids
              using text strings that have to be translated, and rarely changes this list. Any Angular application that needs to support multiple languages
              can create a different translation and use it for each language.</p>

          <p>
            In order to improve accessibility of its components, Clarity added a default English title to all icons
            or non-text interactive elements internal to its components. In order to internationalize them we rely on a
            <code class="clr-code">ClrCommonStrings</code> service that you can declare for your entire app, which will override
            our default titles with the ones you provide. Then you just need to include it as a provider in your application.
          </p>
        <h3 id="examples">Examples</h3>

          <pre><code clr-code-highlight="language-ts" ngNonBindable>
@Injectable()
export class MyCommonStringsService implements ClrCommonStrings &#123;
  open = 'abra';
&#125;
</code></pre>
          <pre><code clr-code-highlight="language-ts" ngNonBindable>
@NgModule(&#123;
  imports: [...],
  declarations: [...],
  providers: [&#123; provide: ClrCommonStrings, useClass: MyCommonStringsService &#125;]
&#125;)
export class AppModule &#123;&#125;
</code></pre>
          <p>
            The list of strings available to configure can be found by simply looking at the declaration of the
            <code class="clr-code">ClrCommonStrings</code> interface, which is found below.
          </p>
          <table class="table">
            <thead>
              <tr>
                <th class="left">Property name</th>
                <th class="left">Purpose</th>
              </tr>
            </thead>
            <tbody>
              <tr *ngFor="let string of strings">
                <td class="left">{{string.key}}</td>
                <td class="left">{{string.role}}</td>
              </tr>
            </tbody>
          </table>

          <p>You might also load your strings from an external service, which you would do something like the following service implementation.
            This would fetch the strings and replace them in the service at runtime, just substitute the server service with your own.</p>

<pre><code clr-code-highlight="language-ts" ngNonBindable>
@Injectable()
export class MyCommonStringsService implements ClrCommonStrings &#123;
  constructor(@Inject(LOCALE_ID) locale: string, server: MyServer) &#123;
    server.fetchTexts(locale).subscribe(texts =&gt; &#123;
      // Assign the strings to the correct properties to implement ClrCommonStrings
      this.open = texts.genericOpenText;
      ...
    &#125;);
  &#125;
&#125;
</code></pre>
        </div>
    </article>
