                Clarity offers two default themes — light and dark. These themes can be used without modification to
                optimize user experience or they can be used as a guideline for creating custom themes in Clarity.

                            Light theme is Clarity’s default. It is best suited to <strong>content-rich
                            applications</strong>
                            where users will be working with the application in <strong>well-lit conditions</strong> for
                            brief periods of time throughout the day. Light theme can help prevent eye strain in
                            applications where a user is expected to <strong>read a large amount of content</strong> —
                            like documentation or a blog.

                            interactive</strong>. A dark theme can help with eye strain if a user works with an
                            application over a long span of time but in a way that requires <strong>focus but not a
                            great

            <h3>Theme Guidelines</h3>
            <p class="p1">
                Themes offer a great deal of flexibility — which can be both a good and bad thing. The Clarity team has
                put continued effort towards <strong>accessibility</strong> and the intentional
                <strong>use of color</strong> so that our end users can add great value to their products with minimal
                investment.
            </p>
            <p class="p1">
                <strong>But theming can put some of those benefits at risk</strong>. Please review the following
                guidelines
                before building a custom theme.
            </p>
            <h5>Use color responsibly</h5>

                <div class="clr-col-12 clr-col-md-6">

                            Use colors that reinforce your brand but in a way that is pleasing.
                        </p>
                        <p class="p1">
                            Save saturated or bright colors in your palette for highlights. And use them sparingly to
                            highlight actions or content.
                        </p>
                        <p class="p1">
                            Harsh colors can cause eye strain for users over time. Avoid using too many bright, neon
                            colors
                            and avoid using highly saturated/bold colors as backgrounds over large areas of content.

            <p>Clarity UI ships with two css files,
                <code class="clr-code">clr-ui.min.css</code> for the light theme and
                <code class="clr-code">clr-ui-dark.min.css</code> for the dark theme. You can consume either one of
                these files and have a fully light or dark-themed Clarity application. If you already use 
                <code class="clr-code">@clr/ui</code> in your project there is nothing more you need to do. 
                If you want to switch
                over to the dark theme use one of the examples below to modify your build process and consume the
                <code class="clr-code">clr-ui-dark.min.css</code> code.</p>
            <h4 style="margin-bottom: 12px;">Angular CLI Builds</h4>
            <p>
                Consume the dark theme code in <code
                    class="clr-code"> clr-ui-dark.min.css</code> by adding it to your styles array in the <code
                    class="clr-code">.angular-cli.json</code> file.
            </p>

            <p>If you need to customize components for your application we suggest starting with either the
                light theme or the dark theme and overriding variables from there to suit your customizations.</p>

            <h4>Two Ways to Theme Clarity</h4>

            <p>With the 3.0 release, there are two ways to theme Clarity: <em>SASS variables</em> and <em>CSS custom properties</em>. The recommended way to theme Clarity is through <a href="//developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/--*" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CSS Custom Properties</a>.</p>

            <p>After the release of Clarity 4.0, SASS based theming will no longer work in Clarity.</p>


            <clr-alert [clrAlertClosable]="false" [clrAlertType]="'danger'" class="margin-top-48">
                <clr-alert-item>
                    <span class="alert-text">
                        SASS-based theming is deprecated in Clarity 3.0 and will no longer work when Clarity 4.0 is released. It is recommended that you convert your themes to use CSS custom properties for the 4.0 release in Spring of 2020.
                    </span>
                </clr-alert-item>
            </clr-alert>

            <h4 class="margin-top-48">SASS-based Theming</h4>

            <p>SASS-based theming is most familiar to those who use SASS/SCSS in their own products to build CSS stylesheets. SASS acts like a superset of CSS that enables convenient nesting syntax and programming-like functionality in a CSS-based language that compiles to CSS. SASS also gives developers variables they can reuse throughout their SASS codebase.</p>

            <p>Clarity has a number of such variables. The <a href="https://github.com/vmware/clarity/blob/master/src/clr-angular/utils/_variables.clarity.scss" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">_variables.clarity.scss</a> file in the Clarity project can serve as a directory for where all of the variable files can be found.</p>

            <p>It is these variables that we override in SASS to build out a new CSS file for our theme.</p>

                            <p>In order to customize the Clarity light theme you will need to build with the Clarity SCSS
                                and
                                overwrite the SCSS variables that set the look-n-feel for each component you need to
                                customize. You will need to build your applications CSS output with Clarity's SCSS.

            <h5>Why is SASS-based theming going away?</h5>

            <p>Once the Clarity Angular library begins to integrate the web components from Clarity Core, SASS-based theming will no longer work. The Clarity Core web components are encapsulated within the shadow DOM. Changes to the CSS at the global level will not be able to affect shadow DOM encapsulated web components through any means outside of CSS custom properties.</p>

            <h4>CSS Custom Properties</h4>

            <p>CSS custom properties are a specification that defines a syntax that allows developers to define "variables" in their stylesheets whose values they can reuse and override. This is a huge improvement for CSS and greatly streamlines theming, as well as the management of complex stylesheets.</p>

            <p>Additionally, CSS custom properties deliver a great deal of flexibility in how developers can implement themes for their applications. Dramatic visual changes can now be realized using CSS and leveraging the native cascade of stylesheets. CSS custom properties are also very simple to override in just a few lines of JavaScript.</p>

            <p>For more information on using CSS custom properties, <a href="//developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/--*" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">see this article on MDN</a>.</p>

        <div style="border-top: 0.05rem solid #ccc; margin-top: 2.4rem;">
            <h3 class="margin-top-48">Different Types of Theming</h3>

            <p>When doing research on how best to deliver a theming solution to our developer community, the Clarity team identified several primary use cases:</p>

            <ul class="list">
                <li>use of a non-default theme, like the dark theme, with no theme switching</li>
                <li>switching between two themes, like a light/dark theme switcher</li>
                <li>"whitelabeling"</li>
                <li>dynamically switching an application between "whitelabeling" options</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>CSS Custom Property Dark Theme</h4>
            
            <p>After adopting custom properties, delivering a dark theme in Clarity no longer requires pointing to a separately built CSS file. Likewise, if your application relies on Clarity but needs a different color scheme, you'll no longer need to rebuild the Clarity CSS at build time.</p>

            <p>Instead, you will redefine the clarity CSS custom properties and include the CSS in your application. <a href="//github.com/mathisscott/clarity-theming-starter/tree/clarity-css-dark-theme" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">An example can be found here</a>.</p>

            <p>If you are already working with a SASS/SCSS file with Clarity SASS variables, clarity has made the conversion easy in that all previous sass variables can be changed to custom properties by replacing leading <code class="clr-code">$</code> with <code class="clr-code">--</code> in the variable name.</p>

            <p>So, the previous SASS variable <code class="clr-code">$clr-alert-info-bg-color</code> would become a custom property of <code class="clr-code">--clr-alert-info-bg-color</code>. <a href="//github.com/mathisscott/clarity-theming-starter/blob/clarity-css-dark-theme/src/_dark-theme.scss" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">This file on github</a> shows an example of what this looks like in practice.</p>

            <h4>Theme Switching</h4>

            <p>A common use case for applications is giving users the ability to switch between predefined universal themes. An example would be switching between a light and a dark theme.</p>

            <p>Before custom properties, this was accomplished by generating two completely different files containing all of the style definitions in Clarity. Each of these files were compiled separately with different SASS variables at their root. Through JavaScript, developers could then enable and disable the stylesheet they wanted to use.</p>

            <p>While elements of this approach remain the same with custom properties, the cumbersome step of compiling and then forcing users to download multiple versions of the full Clarity stylesheet is no longer necessary.</p>

            <p>Instead, our theme only contains the custom property values we want to change when a theme is selected.</p>

            <p>An example of this kind of "theme switching" <a href="//github.com/mathisscott/clarity-theming-starter/tree/clarity-css-dark-theme-switcher" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">can be found here in this github repository</a>.</p>

            <h4>Whitelabeling</h4>

            <p>Whitelabeling is a term that describes a product feature that allows end-users to change a minimal set of colors to aid with brand identity across a company's offerings. Typically, whitelabeling refers to the ability to change navigation or header colors and sometimes elements such as buttons.</p>

            <p>This was incredibly difficult in Clarity prior to custom properties. Due to the aforementioned requirement that teams rebuild the clarity CSS in order to theme any part of it, there was not a good native solution for those seeking to whitelabel its components.</p>

            <p>Because custom properties allows us to change just the styles that we want to override in normal CSS, <a href="//github.com/mathisscott/clarity-theming-starter/tree/clarity-css-whitelabeling" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">whitelabeling Clarity applications is far more streamlined</a>.</p>

            <h4>Dynamic Whitelabeling</h4>

            <p>A feature that often walks hand-in-hand with whitelabeling is some sort of theme generator the customers can use to customize a product to their needs. Again, this is often limited to a subset of styles -- generally concerned with Color and navigation.</p>

            <p>With the ease of accessing and updating CSS custom properties with JavaScript, this is also functionality that is far easier now in Clarity with custom properties. <a href="//github.com/mathisscott/clarity-theming-starter/tree/clarity-css-whitelabel-switcher" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Here is an example demonstrating a theme switcher that uses JavaScript to update CSS custom properties</a>.</p>

            <h3 class="margin-top-48">IE11 Support</h3>

            <p><a href="//caniuse.com/#feat=css-variables" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CSS custom properties are supported in every major browser</a> with the exception of Internet Explorer. If your product does not support this legacy Microsoft browser, then you do not need to read any further.</p>

            <p>If, however, your product has not been able to stop supporting Internet Explorer, Clarity Core can offer some assistance.</p>

            <h4>Setting up IE11 support</h4>

            <p>First, you will need to install Clarity Core and its dependencies: <code class="clr-code">npm install @webcomponents/custom-elements @webcomponents/shadycss @webcomponents/webcomponentsjs ramda @clr/core</code>.</p>

            <h4>Using the polyfills</h4>

            <p>Once the dependencies are in a good place, you will need to import the <code class="clr-code">runCssVarsPolyfill</code> helper from <code class="clr-code">@clr/core</code>. This is what you will use to update the CSS custom properties in Internet Explorer.</p>

            <h4>When to call the polyfills</h4>

            <p><a href="//github.com/mathisscott/clarity-theming-starter/blob/clarity-css-whitelabel-switcher/src/app/app.component.ts" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">As demonstrated in this example</a>, you'll want to call <code class="clr-code">runCssVarsPolyfill()</code> whenever making a change to your custom properties. This includes if you are enabling or disabling stylesheets.</p>

            <p><code class="clr-code">runCssVarsPolyfill()</code> can accept an optional config object if you would like. We suggest <a href="//jhildenbiddle.github.io/css-vars-ponyfill/#/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">familiarizing yourself with the documentation of the <code class="clr-code">css-vars-ponyfill</code></a> before passing in a custom configuration, however.</p>

            <p>In most cases, the Clarity default configuration will be sufficient.</p>
