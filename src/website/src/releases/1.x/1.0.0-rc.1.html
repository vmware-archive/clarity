<h2>Highlights</h2>
<ul class="list-unstyled">
    <li>
        <p>This release does not include schematics to help migration steps for 1.0 yet, so you'll have to manually
            apply the fixes listed here. These are the last breaking changes before we reach 1.0.</p>
        <p>To get this update, run <code class="clr-code">npm i @clr/angular@next @clr/ui@next @clr/icons@next</code>.
            The
            <code class="clr-code">@next</code> tag is necessary only while Clarity 1.0 is in prerelease, afterwards
            it won't be necessary. You can use this
            with any Angular CLI project, even if you've already started to work on it. You may need to run <code class="clr-code">ng update @angular/core @angular/cli</code>
            first to update to Angular 7.</p>
        <h6 breaking-change>Refactored Tree View component (<a href="https://github.com/vmware/clarity/pull/2859"
                target="_blank">#2859</a>)</h6>
        <p>The Tree View component had some internal design issues that prevented fixing some important bugs. This refactoring
            is important to address those problems and the old tree view has been replaced. If you use Tree View in your application,
            review the new documentation and update your uses of it.
