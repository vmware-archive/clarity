        <p>To get this update, run <code class="clr-code">ng update @clr/angular@next</code>.
            The
            <code class="clr-code">@next</code> tag is necessary only while this is in prerelease, afterwards
            it won't be necessary. You can use this
            with any Angular CLI project, even if you've already started to work on it. You may need to run <code class="clr-code">ng update @angular/core @angular/cli</code>
            first to update to Angular 8.</p>
        
        <h6 breaking-change>Support for Angular 8-beta.5 (<a href="https://github.com/vmware/clarity/pull/3146" target="_blank">#3146</a>)</h6>
        <p>This release brings Angular 8-beta.5 support for Clarity, and this Clarity branch will be supported to work with
            Angular 8 while Angular is supported.</p>

        <h6 breaking-change>Simplifying color variables and removing luminance and contrast maps(<a href="https://github.com/vmware/clarity/pull/3131"
                target="_blank">#3131</a>)</h6>
        <p>We've cleaned up a lot of variables and simplified the CSS theming to make it easier to work with. Custom themes may need
            to review their themes for any referenced maps and some new variables were added to capture some missing configurations.
