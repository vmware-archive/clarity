<h2>Highlights</h2>
<h3>Angular 8.0.0-rc.3</h3>
<p>To get this update, run <code class="clr-code">ng update @clr/angular@next</code>.
    The <code class="clr-code">@next</code> tag is necessary only while this is in prerelease, afterwards
    it won't be necessary. You can use this with any Angular CLI project, even if you've already started to
    work on it. You may need to run <code class="clr-code">ng update @angular/core @angular/cli</code>
    first to update to Angular 8.0.0-rc.3 or greater.</p>
