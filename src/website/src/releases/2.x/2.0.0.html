            Welcome to Clarity 2.0! We've worked hard to get to this major milestone, and are excited about the
            future of Clarity! All new features, additions, deprecations and bug-fixes are listed below for an easy
            summarization of what changed between 1.0 and 2.0.
        </p>
        <p>
            This is the second release to follow the support policy. It follows the Angular LTS support
            policy as is outlined in the blog post
            <a href="https://medium.com/claritydesignsystem/updating-the-clarity-release-and-support-strategy-c1e37f7d5a0">here</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
            There are a few things Clarity consumers should take note of:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>We are starting LTS (Long Term Support) for Clarity v1.x and will only be adding security and severe
                bugfixes during this period</li>
            <li>We are no longer supporting Clarity v0.13.x with security and severe bugfixes</li>
            <li>This begins the active development period for Clarity v2.x and we will be adding new features
                <strong>that are not breaking changes</strong> during this period</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            To get this update, run <code class="clr-code">ng update @clr/angular</code>. You can use this with any
            Angular CLI project, even if you've already started to work on it. You may need to run
            <code class="clr-code">ng update @angular/core @angular/cli</code> first to update to Angular 8.
        </p>

        <h6 new-component>Added Vertical Tabs (<a href="https://github.com/vmware/clarity/pull/3102"
                                                  target="_blank">#3102</a>)</h6>
        <p>The addition of vertical tabs now allows consumers to specify <code class="clr-code">clrLayout
            ="vertical"</code> on a <code class="clr-code">clr-tabs container</code>. Please refer to the updated
            <a routerLink="/documentation/tabs">documentation</a> for more info.

        <p>Accordions are designed for use in the main content area. They allow generic content to be collapsed.

        <p>A stepper structures multi-step processes into 2 or more expanding panels that break up complex workflows.
            Under the hood, the stepper is a specialized Accordian. To understand the difference and see examples of
            code in use check out the documentation <a routerLink="/documentation/stepper">here</a>.</p>

        <p>We've cleaned up a lot of variables and simplified the CSS theming to make it easier to work with. Custom themes may need
