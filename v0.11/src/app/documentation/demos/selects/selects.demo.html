            With a select box, users can select one item from a list of values. The selected item is visible when the
            select box is closed.</h5>

            <p>Select boxes are a <code class="clr-code">select</code> element with its <code
                class="clr-code">option</code>s wrapped in a block element with the
                <code class="clr-code">.select</code> classname applied to it. To use a select box
                within a form, it can be wrapped in another block element with the <code
                class="clr-code">.form-group</code> classname.</p>

            <h3 id="guidelines">Usage</h3>

            <p>Use a select box for a list of items that a user does not need to see all the time.</p>

            <p>A common strategy is to combine an input field with a select box so that a user can enter
                a value and qualify it with a menu item. For example, the user might enter a number in an
                input field and select the units from the select box.</p>

            <p>Donâ€™t confuse a select box with a <a routerLink="./dropdowns">dropdown menu</a>.
                Select boxes are for setting options and work best in forms. Dropdowns are for presenting
                actions and most appropriate in a header.</p>

            <h4 id="number-of-list-items">Number of List Items</h4>

            <p>Typically, a select box contains between 3 and 12 items. For fewer than 3 items or to
                present choices that are always visible, consider a <a
                routerLink="./radios">radio button</a>.</p>

            <h4 id="label">Label</h4>

            <p>A select box requires a brief introductory label that describes the items in the menu.
                Use sentence-style capitalization for both the label and the menu items.</p>
