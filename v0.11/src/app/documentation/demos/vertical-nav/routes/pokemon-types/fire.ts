            Fire is one of the three basic elemental types along with Water and Grass, 
            which constitute the three starter Pok√©mon. This creates a 
            simple triangle to explain the type concept easily to new players. 
            Fire types are notoriously rare in the early stages of the games 
            so choosing the Fire variation starter is often a plus.
