            <p>
                Wizards are used to help users walk through a defined step-by-step process. Each step
                is in the sidebar on the left. As users complete steps, the steps are marked with a
                green bar to the left.
            </p>
            <p>
                Wizards should have at least 2 steps. If your wizard exceeds 10 steps, consider combining
                similar steps.
            </p>
            <p>Here is when you might want to use a wizard over just a normal form:</p>
            <ul class="list">
                <li>if the user is <b>not familiar with the domain knowledge</b> needed to complete a process</li>
                <li>if the user needs to accomplish a goal that has <b>many steps</b> in it</li>
                <li>if steps must be completed in a <b>specific sequence</b></li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                There are multiple sizes for wizards. The Clarity wizard defaults to <b>x-large</b> but
                different sizes could be used based on the content and screen sizes you are planning to
                support. Always remember to test responsiveness as you design and use wizards. The best size
                is one that doesn’t feel like there is too much or too little whitespace. If you’re unsure,
                test different ones to see which looks best.

            <h3 id="building-steps">Building Steps</h3>

            <p>
                When building a step, it’s important to organize related tasks in it. Unrelated tasks should
                be separate into a new step. This helps preserve context around the step being completed.
            </p>
            <p>
                If a step’s content scrolls, consider splitting the step into two steps or use a larger
                sized wizard. Scrolling content can sometimes be overlooked and users may try to progress
                to the next step unintentionally.
            </p>
            <p>
                It’s best to include only the required tasks in a step so users know they need to fill out
                everything they see. Optional tasks slow the process of filling out a wizard.
            </p>

            <h3 id="conditional-steps">Conditional Steps</h3>

            <p>
                Conditional wizards change step content or the number of steps based on the entry from
                another step. Non-conditional wizards are preferable. However, if a conditional wizard is
                necessary, it is preferred to update the next step to be completed. Otherwise, users might lose
                context of what change was made.

                The wizard is hidden and shown by toggling a boolean value assigned to the
                <code class="clr-code">clrWizardOpen</code> input. The toggling of these values is
                shown in the code examples below.
            </p>

            <p>
                Note that you will probably want unique booleans for hiding and showing wizards
                when you have more than one wizard on a page. If hiding and showing are all assigned
                to the same boolean, the wizards will all hide and show together. This is probably
                not the intended experience.
            </p>

            <p>
                The wizard comes in three different sizes: medium, large, and extra-large. You can set
                the size by providing the value as an input &mdash; <code class="clr-code">clrWizardSize</code>.
                If not specified, the wizard will <b>default to extra-large</b>. Sizing options for
                <code class="clr-code">clrWizardSize</code> are: <code class="clr-code">md</code>,
                <code class="clr-code">lg</code>, and <code class="clr-code">xl</code>.

            <p>
                Depending on the flow of the wizard, you may want to skip or add steps in the wizard.
                In the 0.9.0 wizard, this is accomplished by using the <code class="clr-code">*ngIf</code>
                Angular directive.

                If you are using <code class="clr-code">*ngFor</code> to generate your wizard pages and
                still want to use <code class="clr-code">*ngIf</code> to hide them, you will want to
                follow <a href="https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/guide/structural-directives.html#!#one-per-element"
                target="_blank">the Angular team's recommendations on nested structural directives</a>.
            </p>

            <p>
                At a high level, this means wrapping your <code class="clr-code">&lt;clr-wizard-page
                *ngIf="yourCondition"&gt;</code> inside a <code class="clr-code">&lt;ng-container
                *ngFor="let page of pages"&gt;</code> element.
            </p>

            <p>
                Alternatively, you could add and remove elements from the array of pages you are sending

                There may be times when you need end-users to jump to a specific step in a wizard. The
                way to do this is pass the page object to the <code class="clr-code">currentPage</code>
                property of the wizard's
                <code class="clr-code">WizardNavigationService</code> provider.
            </p>
            <p>
                The safest way to ensure that end-users do not wind up in a bad state is to make sure
                that the page to which they are navigating is completed and, if not, send users to the
                last valid page using the <code class="clr-code">setLastEnabledPageCurrent()</code>
                method on the same <code class="clr-code">WizardNavigationService</code>
                provider, as in the example below.
            </p>

            <h3 id="overriding-the-title-in-the-wizard-page">Different Page Title in the Sidenav</h3>

            <p>
                By default, the nav item on the right-hand side will display the same title as the title
                inside the <code class="clr-code">&lt;ng-template clrPageTitle&gt;</code> in your
                <code class="clr-code">&lt;clr-wizard-page&gt;</code>. In fact, this is the <em>only</em>
                element that is required inside your <code class="clr-code">&lt;clr-wizard-page&gt;</code>.
                It provides not only the title at the top of the content area but also the item in the
                sidenav to the left.
            </p>

            <p>
                Sometimes, however, having the title in the content area match the nav item is not a
                desired behavior. The title in the content area may be too long or the nav item may
                need to update based on changes elsewhere in the wizard.
            </p>

            <p>
                To accomplish this customization, you can use a <code
                class="clr-code">&lt;ng-template clrPageNavTitle&gt;</code> element. When placed inside,
                a <code class="clr-code">&lt;clr-wizard-page&gt;</code>, a <code class="clr-code">clrPageNavTitle</code>
                template reference will be used in the nav sidebar of the wizard instead of the content title.
            </p>

            <p>
                As with any Angular content, you can also use projection to change the titles in either a
                <code class="clr-code">clrPageTitle</code> or <code class="clr-code">clrPageNavTitle</code>
                whenever you need to.
            </p>

            <h3 id="custom-page-buttons">Overriding Buttons at the Page Level</h3>

            <p>
                As part of creating a wizard, you need to include a set of default buttons of types finish,
                next, previous, and cancel as a direct child of your <code
                class="clr-code">&lt;clr-wizard&gt;</code> element.
            </p>

            <clr-wizard-default-buttons></clr-wizard-default-buttons>

            <p>
                These buttons can be overridden at the page level, however, with other buttons of the same
                type (but with different text) or with completely custom buttons. To override the default
                buttons, include a new set of buttons inside a <code class="clr-code">&lt;ng-template
                clrPageButtons&gt;</code>
                template reference element. Sets of buttons defined at the page level will override the
                default buttons defined at the wizard level.
            </p>

            <h3 id="custom-buttons">Custom Buttons and Page-Level Button Overrides</h3>

            <p>
                A <em>page override</em> is defining a button at the page level in place of a button of the
                same type at the wizard level. These types include finish, danger, next, previous, and cancel.
                If you override the click events of these buttons with an output like <code
                class="clr-code">clrWizardPagePreventDefault</code>, you can also short-circuit the default
                action of the button to define your own custom action at the page level.
            </p>

            <p>
                A <em>custom button</em> is a different beast entirely. Custom buttons are not like
                page overrides. They have no action assigned to them. So you will need to use the
                <code class="clr-code">clrWizardPageCustomButton</code> output to assign an action to your custom
                buttons. The output receives the custom button type which should allow you to route your wizard's
                behavior based on the type of button it receives.
            </p>

            <p>
                You can use specified custom button types such as <code class="clr-code">custom-finish</code>,
                <code class="clr-code">custom-next</code>,
                <code class="clr-code">custom-danger</code>,
                <code class="clr-code">custom-previous</code>, or
                <code class="clr-code">custom-cancel</code> to have your custom buttons inherit the styling
                of the button listed in the latter part of the button type. Note, however, that these
                custom buttons <em>do not</em> kick off the actions associated with their styled types.
                You have to tell a wizard what you want a button to do.
            </p>

            <p>
                By default, a custom button will be styled as an outline button. Meaning it will look like a
                "previous" type of button. For example, you would get an action blue, outlined button with the
                text "Wallaby" inside it if you created a button with the following declaration: <code
                class="clr-code">&lt;clr-wizard-button [type]="'wallaby'"&gt;Wallaby&lt;/clr-wizard-button&gt;</code>.
                And if your page was listening to the <code class="clr-code">clrWizardPageCustomButton</code> output,
                your event handler would receive the button type <code class="clr-code">wallaby</code> as a parameter
                when the custom button was clicked.
            </p>

            <p>
                Reference the following example:

            <h3 id="wizard-with-form-validation">Wizard with Form Validation</h3>

            <p>
                You can use form validation with the wizard. If you wish to disable the next button until
                the form is valid, you can do so by setting the
                <code class="clr-code">clrWizardPageNextDisabled</code> input of the
                <code class="clr-code">&lt;clr-wizard-page&gt;</code> to the form’s valid property as shown
                in the example.
            </p>

            <p>
                Note also in the example how the text of the third step nav item changes as the form is
                validated.
            </p>

            <h3 id="wizard-with-asynchronous-validation">Wizard with Asynchronous Validation</h3>

            <p>
                Some applications may need to make an an asynchronous call for server-side
                validation of form input. The example below demonstrates how you can prevent
                the wizard from moving forward with the next button by setting the <code class="clr-code">clrWizardPagePreventDefault</code>
                input to false. Then enable it
                by programmatically calling next when the asynchronous form validation passes.
            </p>

            <p>
                While not a recommended pattern, some applications need to validate data before
                finishing the wizard &mdash; as opposed to the sort of page-to-page validation
                demonstrated above.
            </p>

            <p>
                The approach to doing this on the final page of a wizard is very similar to validating
                each page with the only twist being where the <code class="clr-code">finish()</code>
                method should be called.

            <h3 id="wizard-stop-navigation">Preventing Navigation and Disabling the Stepnav</h3>

            <p>
                If a wizard concludes with a long-running task or validation, preventing a user from
                closing the wizard, jumping to a new page in the wizard, or navigating forwards or
                backwards may be required. The Clarity wizard offers two inputs for disabling navigation.
            </p>
            <p>
                The first is the <code class="clr-code">clrWizardPreventNavigation</code> input on
                the <code class="clr-code">clr-wizard</code> component. When set to
                <code class="clr-code">true</code>, this input prevents all stepnav links and buttons
                from navigating away from the current wizard page.
            </p>
            <p>
                The next input on the <code class="clr-code">clr-wizard</code> component is more specific
                to the stepnav. When <code class="clr-code">clrWizardDisableStepnav</code> is set to
                <code class="clr-code">true</code>, it only disables the links in the stepnav on the left
                of the wizard. Buttons still work.
            </p>
            <p>
                Examples of when and how to use both are demonstrated in the following example.

            <h3 id="wizard-reset">Resetting the Wizard</h3>

            <p>
                While the easiest way to restore a wizard back to its pristine state is to destroy and
                recreate it, there are use cases where this is not feasible. If you need to reset
                the wizard while it is open, destroying and recreating it would be a poor experience
                for users. Likewise, some applications are architected such that it is less expensive
                to reuse an instance of a wizard instead of destroying it and making the backend
                calls necessary to re-initialize a new instance.
            </p>

            <p>
                The Clarity wizard includes a <code class="clr-code">reset()</code> convenience method.
                In order to use it, you would need a reference to the wizard in your host component and
                can call reset from there. In the example below, we use <code
                class="clr-code">wizard.reset()</code> which references the ViewChild
                <code class="clr-code">&lt;clr-wizard #wizard&gt;</code> in the host component's template.
            </p>

            <p>
                The <code class="clr-code">reset()</code> method resets the wizard's
                navigation and page state. So it clears out any pages that were
                marked completed and sets the active page back to the first page of the wizard.
            </p>

            <p>
                When resetting the wizard, it is your responsibility to reset your wizard's
                model. This can be done either as part of the action that calls the reset, as in
                the example below, or with an event handler that listens to the
                <code class="clr-code">clrWizardOnReset</code> output.
            </p>

            <clr-wizard-reset></clr-wizard-reset>

            <h5 id="force-forward">Making users go back through skipped pages</h5>

            <p>
                A different kind of wizard reset is one that occurs during navigation. For wizards
                that use the next button to perform custom validations, users navigating backwards
                in the wizard using the stepnav is problematic.
            </p>

            <p>
                A user could, for instance, navigate from page 5 back to page 2 with the stepnav,
                make changes on page 2, and then navigate back to page 5 (again using the stepnav).
                The validation on the wizard would not run until the user clicked next or finish on
                page 5, at which point they would be surprised with validation errors.
            </p>

            <p>
                To avoid this, the Clarity wizard includes an input
                <code class="clr-code">clrWizardForceForwardNavigation</code> which resets pages
                when navigating backwards when set to <code class="clr-code">true</code>.
            </p>

            <p>
                In the above example, pages 2, 3, and 4 would be reset to incomplete when the
                user navigated from page 5 to page 2 using the stepnav.
            </p>

            <p>
                This functionality is called “force forward” because it prevents users from jumping
                backwards and forwards. An example is shown in the demo below.
            </p>

            <clr-wizard-force-forward></clr-wizard-force-forward>

            <h3 id="alternative-cancel">Providing an Alternative Cancel for the Wizard</h3>

            <p>
                The Clarity wizard allows users to circumvent the default cancel/close action at
                both the page and wizard level to enable their own functionality to validate,
                prompt users, or reset their data.
            </p>
            <p>
                At the wizard level, setting the <code class="clr-code">clrWizardPreventDefaultCancel</code>
                input to true prevents the wizard’s cancel routine from running on any page. When the
                <code class="clr-code">clrWizardPreventDefaultCancel</code> input is set, users must
                also assign an event handler to the <code class="clr-code">clrWizardOnCancel</code>
                output and manually call <code class="clr-code">close()</code> on their instance of
                the wizard for the cancel action to take effect.
            </p>
            <p>
                That cancel/close functionality of the wizard can also be overridden at the page
                level. Users must set the <code class="clr-code">clrWizardPagePreventDefaultCancel</code>
                input to true on the <code class="clr-code">&lt;clr-wizard-page&gt;</code> declaration
                and likewise supply an event handler to the
                <code class="clr-code">clrWizardPageOnCancel</code> output. This event handler will
                also need to manually call <code class="clr-code">close()</code> for the expected
                wizard cancel functionality to take effect.
            </p>
            <p>
                In the case of a conflict where the cancel action is overridden at both the page and
                wizard levels, the page level takes precedence.
                <code class="clr-code">clrWizardOnCancel</code> will never be emitted. The example
                below demonstrates this.
            </p>

            <clr-wizard-alt-cancel></clr-wizard-alt-cancel>

            <h5 id="no-cancel">But what if I do not want any cancel buttons?</h5>

            <p>
                There are times when you may want your end-users to finish hey wizard before
                they can do anything else. This may include installation routines or set up
                of your application. In these instances, it makes sense to use a wizard that
                does not have a cancel button and is also not closable.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you do not want a cancel action in your wizard, do not include a cancel
                button in your default set of buttons or do not include it in your
                <code class="clr-code">&lt;ng-template clrPageButtons&gt;</code> template
                reference at the page level.
            </p>
            <p>
                This also applies to other button types like previous or next. Note, however,
                that omission of next, previous, and finish buttons is not recommended and
                could confuse end-users of your application.
            </p>
            <p>
                The example below demonstrates a wizard without cancel buttons that is also
                set to not be closable. The only way to close it is to the click all the way
                through it.

            <h3 id="alternative-cancel">Providing an Alternative Next for the Wizard</h3>

            <p>
                Just like with <code class="clr-code">clrWizardPreventDefaultCancel</code>,
                the Clarity wizard allows users to override the default primary button actions at
                both the page and wizard level. This includes danger, finish, and next buttons.
            </p>
            <p>
                The use case for this is when you want the wizard to validate its contents
                whenever the next button is clicked. It is less overt than manipulating the
                <code class="clr-code">clrWizardPageNextDisabled</code> to enable or disable
                a wizard page's primary buttons, as demonstrated in the form validation example above.
            </p>
            <p>
                Overriding next, finish, and danger buttons at the wizard level involves setting
                the <code class="clr-code">clrWizardPreventDefaultNext</code>
                input to true. This prevents the wizard from executing the built-in methods that finish
                the wizard and move the wizard to the next page.
            </p>
            <p>
                Using <code class="clr-code">clrWizardPreventDefaultNext</code> requires that you handle
                the <code class="clr-code">clrWizardOnNext</code> and
                <code class="clr-code">clrWizardOnFinish</code> event emitters in your host component's
                code. These routines will need to call
                <code class="clr-code">wizard.forceNext()</code> and
                <code class="clr-code">wizard.forceFinish()</code>, respectively.
                <code class="clr-code">forceNext()</code> and <code class="clr-code">forceFinish()</code>
                perform the work of finishing the wizard and moving it to the next page without the
                checks and event emissions involved with calling the default
                <code class="clr-code">next()</code> and <code class="clr-code">finish()</code>
                methods in the wizard.
            </p>
            <p>
                You can override the primary button actions at a page level by using the
                <code class="clr-code">clrWizardPagePreventDefaultNext</code>
                input.
            </p>

                As with wizard level overrides, you will need to provide an event handler for
                the <code class="clr-code">clrWizardPageNext</code> and
                <code class="clr-code">clrWizardPageFinish</code> outputs. If your specific page
                does not have a finish button, there is no need to handle
                the <code class="clr-code">clrWizardPageFinish</code> event. The same holds true
                for wizard pages that do not have next buttons.
            </p>
            <p>
                Also similar to the output routines at the wizard level, your page-level methods will
                need to manually call the <code class="clr-code">wizard.forceNext()</code> and
                <code class="clr-code">wizard.forceFinish()</code> methods to bring that functionality
                back to the overridden page.
            </p>
            <p>
                Just like with the cancel overrides, the page level override is used in place of the
                wizard level override when a specific page has them both set. The example
                below shows how this happens.
            </p>

            <h3 id="non-closable-wizard">Non-Closable Wizard</h3>

            <p>In some circumstances, you may want to not show the closing × icon in the top right of the
                Wizard modal. You can remove this close × icon by setting the
                <code class="clr-code">clrWizardClosable</code> input to <code class="clr-code">false</code>.</p>

            <p>
                The Clarity wizard is a complex component made up of a number of subcomponents. Each
                Clarity wizard also has a number of services whose chief responsibility is handling
                communication between the wizard and its subcomponents.
            </p>

            <p>
                The subcomponents that make up the wizard include a collection of buttons, wizard pages,
                the “step-nav” to the left of the wizard’s content area, and the “step-nav items” which
                constitute the links that appear in the step-nav.
            </p>

            <p>
                The Clarity wizard also has a number of providers (services). The most important of these
                services are the <code class="clr-code">WizardNavigationService</code> and the
                <code class="clr-code">PageCollectionService</code>. At a high-level, the
                <code class="clr-code">WizardNavigationService</code> (or “nav service”) manages the state
                of the current page in a wizard, as well as functionality and communication related to
                making pages current. The <code class="clr-code">PageCollectionService</code> (or “page
                collection”) handles functionality that treats the pages within a wizard as a group of objects.
            </p>
            <p>
                In the following sections, we will briefly touch upon the most important components and
                services related to the wizard, as well as their most notable inputs, outputs, and public
                methods and properties.
            </p>

            <h5>The wizard</h5>

            <p>
                The wizard component is a sort of meta-component that brings together a group of services
                and subcomponents. Most of the time, everything you need to do with the wizard can be done
                through a reference to the wizard in your host component.
            </p>

            <pre><code clr-code-highlight="language-typescript">@Component(&#123;
    ...
&#125;)
export class WizardJumpToDemo &#123;
    @ViewChild("ohai") wizard: ClrWizard; // makes wizard accessible through this.wizard!!!
    ...
</code></pre>

        <pre><code clr-code-highlight="language-html">&lt;clr-wizard #ohai [(clrWizardOpen)]="open">
    &lt;!-- the '#wizard' up there creates the reference that your ViewChild property looks for --&gt;
    &lt;clr-wizard-title&gt;Your Wizard&lt;/clr-wizard-title&gt;
    ...
</code></pre>

            <p>
                Because the wizard’s functionality involves mostly monitoring the state and managing
                communications with child components, the wizard expects some subcomponents to be declared in order for
                it to avoid an existential crisis.
            </p>

            <p>
                Every wizard needs a <code class="clr-code">&lt;clr-wizard-title&gt;</code>,
                <code class="clr-code">&lt;clr-wizard-button&gt;</code>, and at least one
                <code class="clr-code">&lt;clr-wizard-page&gt;</code> component to be declared as
                its children. If these sub-components are not present, the wizard will throw an error.
            </p>

            <p>
                As a convenience, wizards give you hooks to all of their services. If you have a reference to
                the wizard in your host component as in the example above, you can access all of the important
                nav service and page collection functionality. Specifically, the above example could call
                <code class="clr-code">this.wizard.navService</code> or
                <code class="clr-code">this.wizard.pageCollection</code> to access the nav service or page
                collection, respectively.
            </p>

            <h6>Inputs of note</h6>
            <ul class="list">
                <li>
                    <code class="clr-code">clrWizardSize</code> (string) sets the size of the wizard.
                    Acceptable values are
                    <code class="clr-code">md</code>, <code class="clr-code">lg</code>, and
                    <code class="clr-code">xl</code> representing medium, large, and extra-large wizards.
                    <code class="clr-code">xl</code> is default.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <code class="clr-code">clrWizardClosable</code>> (boolean) hides or reveals the
                    close “X” in the top right. If false, the close “X” will not be present. The property
                    defaults to true.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <code class="clr-code">clrWizardOpen</code>> (boolean) hides or shows the wizard, in
                    the same way that <code class="clr-code">clrModalOpen</code> hides or shows a modal.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <code class="clr-code">clrWizardPreventDefaultCancel</code>> (boolean) prevents a
                    user’s cancel action from closing the wizard. Defaults to false.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <code class="clr-code">clrWizardForceForwardNavigation</code>> (boolean)
                    sets pages to incomplete when they are skipped over because a user navigates
                    backwards using the stepnav. Most useful when validation is occurring on a page-by-page
                    basis when the next button is clicked.
                </li>
                <li>
                    When set to true, <code class="clr-code">clrWizardPreventNavigation</code>> (boolean)
                    disables the buttons in the footer, the links in the stepnav to the left, and the close
                    "X" in the top right of the wizard if present.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <code class="clr-code">clrWizardDisableStepnav</code>> (boolean) disables the links in
                    the stepnav when set to true.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h6>Outputs of note</h6>
            <ul class="list">
                <li>
                    <code class="clr-code">clrWizardOpenChange</code>> is an output that fires an event
                    after the wizard has opened.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <code class="clr-code">clrWizardOnCancel</code>> fires an event after the wizard has
                    been canceled and, in most cases, closed. This output can be used with the
                    <code class="clr-code">clrWizardPreventDefaultCancel</code> input to
                    implement custom functionality when a user wants to close or cancel a wizard.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <code class="clr-code">clrWizardOnFinish</code>> emits an event after a wizard has
                    been completed &mdash; once the finish button on the last page has been clicked. If
                    you wanted to reset the wizard after it was finished, this would be a good output to consider.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <code class="clr-code">clrWizardOnReset</code>> emits an event after the wizard has
                    reset all of its pages to incomplete and also reset its navigation to make the first
                    page in the step nav current.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <code class="clr-code">clrWizardCurrentPageChanged</code>> is fired after the current
                    page of the wizard has been changed.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h6>Useful properties on the wizard</h6>
            <ul class="list">
                <li>
                    <code class="clr-code">wizard.currentPage</code> will retrieve the current page
                    object (<code class="clr-code">WizardPage</code>) of the wizard.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <code class="clr-code">wizard.isLast</code> returns a boolean telling you if the
                    current page is the last page in the wizard.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <code class="clr-code">wizard.isFirst</code> will also return a boolean, but this
                    one will tell you if the current page is the first page in the wizard.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h6>Useful methods on the wizard</h6>
            <ul class="list">
                <li>
                    <code class="clr-code">wizard.open()</code> opens the wizard.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <code class="clr-code">wizard.close()</code> just closes the wizard but bypasses
                    event emitters associated with finish and cancel. Use this method on the wizard
                    to implement custom cancel or finish methods in your host component to avoid any
                    circular event emission.
                </li>
                <li>
                    You can pass a boolean to <code class="clr-code">wizard.toggle()</code> to hide
                    or show the wizard. <code class="clr-code">wizard.toggle(false)</code> will hide
                    the wizard and <code class="clr-code">wizard.toggle(true)</code> will show it.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <code class="clr-code">wizard.previous()</code> will try to move the wizard to the
                    page immediately before the current page &mdash; if it can. It will fail silently
                    if the current page has no previous page to which it can move.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <code class="clr-code">wizard.next()</code> will try to move the wizard to the page
                    immediately after the current page. It will also fail silently if the current page
                    has no page that follows it.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <code class="clr-code">wizard.finish()</code> will initiate the routines associated
                    with completing the wizard, as if a finish button had been clicked on the last page.
                    You can use <code class="clr-code">wizard.finish()</code> in your code if you are
                    using a custom finish or danger button on the last page in your wizard.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <code class="clr-code">wizard.cancel()</code> will invoke the cancel routines for the
                    wizard as if the close “X” or cancel button had been clicked. This should probably only
                    be used if you have a custom cancel button that you need to wire up or if you want to
                    cancel the wizard programmatically. If you are trying to circumvent the wizard’s cancel
                    routine altogether, you would be better off using
                    <code class="clr-code">wizard.close()</code>.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <code class="clr-code">wizard.goTo()</code> accepts a string representing the id of the
                    page you want the wizard to make current as a parameter. If you have references to
                    your pages in your host component, the page id can be retrieved with
                    <code class="clr-code">wizardpage.id</code> and can be passed into
                    <code class="clr-code">wizard.goTo()</code> &mdash;
                    <code class="clr-code">this.wizard.goTo(this.wizardpage.id)</code>. Note that
                    <code class="clr-code">wizard.goTo()</code> checks to see if preceding pages have been
                    completed before navigating to the specified page. If they have not been, it doesn’t
                    do anything.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <code class="clr-code">wizard.reset()</code> resets all pages' completed states to false
                    and makes the first page in the wizard the current page &mdash; as if the wizard had
                    never been opened before. See the demo below for a more extensive example and explanation.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h5>The wizard page</h5>

            <p>
                Besides the wizard, the second most important component is the wizard page. This is
                because users often want to customize at the page level, instead of the wizard level.
            </p>
            <p>
                Just like the wizard, the wizard page needs an expected element within it or it will
                throw an error. Each wizard page needs a
                <code class="clr-code">&lt;ng-template clrPageTitle&gt;</code> templateRef inside of
                it. Without this, the wizard page will have an existential crisis and not know what to
                call itself.
            </p>
            <p>
                By default, the content of the <code class="clr-code">&lt;ng-template clrPageTitle&gt;</code>
                templateRef will appear as the title in the content area of the wizard when the page
                is current as well as in the page's associated link in the step nav to the left.
            </p>
            <p>
                You can also save a reference to a wizard page in your host component if you want.
                Each page has hooks to the nav service and page collection providers shared between
                the wizard and its subcomponents.
            </p>

            <pre><code clr-code-highlight="language-typescript">@Component(&#123;

    get pageAreDone(): boolean &123;
        return this.firstPage.completed &amp;&amp; this.secondPage.completed;

        ...
    &lt;/clr-wizard-page&gt;
    ...
</code></pre>

            <h6>Inputs of note</h6>
            <ul class="list">
                <li>
                    <code class="clr-code">clrWizardPageNextDisabled</code> is a boolean that
                    disables the next button. It can be used to force validation on the current
                    page before allowing users to move to the next page or finish a wizard.
                    This is <code class="clr-code">false</code> by default.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <code class="clr-code">clrWizardPagePreventDefault</code> is a boolean that
                    circumvents all actions (cancel, finish, next, and previous) when the page
                    is current. This can be used in combination with the outputs below to write
                    your own wizard navigation procedures. This input is
                    <code class="clr-code">false</code> by default.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Most users, however, only want to monitor or circumvent the cancellation
                    of the wizard. <code class="clr-code">clrWizardPagePreventDefaultCancel</code>
                    does that. It is a boolean input that, if set to true, prevents the cancel
                    action from firing when the page is current. Also
                    <code class="clr-code">false</code> by default.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h6>Outputs of note</h6>
            <ul class="list">
                <li>
                    <code class="clr-code">clrWizardPageOnCommit</code> is an output that emits
                    after a page is marked completed by user action. Generally, this happens
                    after danger, finish, or next buttons are clicked. It will not be fired
                    if the page is marked completed programmatically.

                <li>
                    <code class="clr-code">clrWizardPageOnLoad</code> is emitted after a page is
                    made the current page. It cannot circumvent making a page current but it
                    will notify you when a page has been made current and it delivers the
                    page’s id as a string.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <code class="clr-code">clrWizardPageOnCancel</code> is an output that fires
                    when a user's action on a page initiates the wizard’s cancel routine. This
                    output, combined with the <code class="clr-code">clrWizardPagePreventDefaultCancel</code>
                    or <code class="clr-code">clrWizardPagePreventDefault</code> inputs, allows you
                    to customize or rewrite the cancellation of a wizard from a page level.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Wizard pages also have a set of outputs that emit when different buttons
                    are clicked in the wizard. Note that these events are only emitted for the
                    page when the page is current. These outputs include:
                    <code class="clr-code">clrWizardPageFinish</code> when the finish button is
                    clicked, <code class="clr-code">clrWizardPagePrevious</code> when the previous button
                    is clicked, <code class="clr-code">clrWizardPageNext</code> when the next button
                    is clicked, <code class="clr-code">clrWizardPageDanger</code> when a danger button
                    is clicked, <code class="clr-code">clrWizardPagePrimary</code> when a
                    next/finish/danger button is clicked, and
                    <code class="clr-code">clrWizardPageCustomButton</code> when any custom button
                    is clicked. All of these outputs (and <code class="clr-code">clrWizardPageOnCancel</code>)
                    can be combined with the <code class="clr-code">clrWizardPagePreventDefault</code>
                    input to create a unique, page-based behavior. More examples are available
                    in the demos below.

            <h6>Useful properties of the wizard page</h6>
            <ul class="list">
                <li>
                    <code class="clr-code">wizardpage.id</code> returns the id of the page as a string.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <code class="clr-code">wizardpage.completed</code> is a boolean that tells you if
                    the page has been completed or not. If <code class="clr-code">true</code>, the page
                    has been completed. If <code class="clr-code">false</code>, it has not.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <code class="clr-code">wizardpage.current</code> is a boolean tells you if the page
                    is the current page or not.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h6>Useful methods of the wizard page</h6>
            <ul class="list">
                <li>
                    <code class="clr-code">wizardpage.makeCurrent()</code> tells the nav service to make
                    <code class="clr-code">wizardpage</code> the current page. This method circumvents
                    checks to see if the page can be made current. Use
                    <code class="clr-code">wizard.goTo()</code> if you want to nav service to validate
                    whether the specified page can be made current or not.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h5>Providers (Services)</h5>

            <p>
                The Clarity wizard has a number of services (providers) that are created by the wizard
                and shared among all of its subcomponents. The two that you are most likely to interact
                with are the <code class="clr-code">WizardNavigationService</code> and
                <code class="clr-code">PageCollectionService</code>.
            </p>

            <h6>WizardNavigationService</h6>

            <p>
                The <code class="clr-code">WizardNavigationService</code> or “nav service” is the wizard’s
                executive assistant. It communicates with the wizard, the pages, and the
                <code class="clr-code">PageCollectionService</code> to make sure everyone stays in sync.
                Most of what the nav service does is already available to you through convenience methods
                on the wizard. Methods like <code class="clr-code">next()</code>,
                <code class="clr-code">previous()</code>, and <code class="clr-code">finish()</code>.
            </p>
            <p>
                It may have seemed, initially, that the wizard was super-helpful and doing lots of work.
                But the truth is the nav service does all the work. The wizard just gets all the credit!
            </p>
            <p>
                Because much of what the nav service does is behind-the-scenes, there is really only
                a couple of methods and properties on the nav service that may interest you:
            </p>

            <ul class="list">
                <li>
                    <code class="clr-code">wizard.navService.currentPage</code> is a getter/setter
                    That will return the current page is called on its own or set the current page
                    to any WizardPage object that is passed to it. This bypasses most of the checks
                    involved with setting the current page but still emits a
                    <code class="clr-code">pageOnLoad</code> event.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <code class="clr-code">wizard.navService.goTo()</code> takes either the id of a page
                    or the page object itself and checks to see if it can make the page current. This is
                    slightly more flexible than <code class="clr-code">wizard.goTo()</code> which only
                    takes a page id.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h6>PageCollectionService</h6>

            <p>
                The <code class="clr-code">PageCollectionService</code> &mdash; or “page collection” &mdash;
                groups all of the pages in the wizard together and acts as kind of a librarian. If you
                are looking for a page or even a group of pages, the page collection has you covered.
                The page collection also handles a small set of bulk actions on the pages in a wizard.
            </p>

            <p><b>Properties</b></p>

            <ul class="list">
                <li>
                    <code class="clr-code">wizard.pageCollection.pages</code> is a
                    <code class="clr-code">QueryList</code> of all the pages in a wizard.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <code class="clr-code">wizard.pageCollection.pagesAsArray</code> is
                    a convenient getter that returns
                    <code class="clr-code">wizard.pageCollection.pages</code> as an array of page objects.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <p><b>Methods</b></p>
            <ul class="list">
                <li>
                    If you know a page’s id, you can pass it as a string parameter to
                    <code class="clr-code">wizard.pageCollection.getPageById()</code> and it will
                    return the page if it exists in the page collection.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Alternatively, you can pass the page’s index in the list of pages as a number
                    parameter to <code class="clr-code">wizard.pageCollection.getPageByIndex()</code>
                    to get the page returned back to you.
                </li>
                <li>
                    If you have a page and you need to know where it is in the list of pages, you
                    can pass the page object as a parameter to
                    <code class="clr-code">wizard.pageCollection.getPageIndex()</code>
                    and it will return the page’s numeric index.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Passing a page object to <code class="clr-code">wizard.pageCollection.getPreviousPage()</code>
                    as a parameter will return you the page before it in the collection or null
                    if your page object is the first page in the collection.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Continuing the trend, you can pass a page object as a parameter to
                    <code class="clr-code">wizard.pageCollection.getNextPage()</code> and it will
                    return the page after your page object in the collection or null if your
                    page object is the last page in the collection.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <code class="clr-code">wizard.pageCollection.updateCompletedStates()</code>
                    is a function that cleans up the page collection by figuring out the first page
                    marked as incomplete and the collection and then marking every page after
                    it incomplete as well. This is a useful method if you handle a lot of page
                    state programmatically.
