# Template Naming 
Clarity originally offered the UI Template sketch file for download. Starting with Calrity v0.10.11 Clarity converted
 to Sketch Libraries and began offering a zip file download as you see in the ../sketchLibraries directory. 
 
 The Clarity file `Clarity-Template-0.10.11.sketch` was extracted from `../sketchLibraries/Clarity-UI-Library-0-10.11
 .sketch.zip` and renamed. This was done to support the directives that build download links on the /news page from 
 the `release-list.json` config file.
