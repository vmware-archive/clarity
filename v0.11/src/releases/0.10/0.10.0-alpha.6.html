        <h6>Import All Shapes in Clarity Icons</h6>
        Before Clarity v0.9.15, if you wanted to load all shapes, you had to import all sets one by one after loading
        ClarityIcons:

        <pre><code clr-code-highlight="language-ts" ngNonBindable>
import &#x22;clarity-icons&#x22;;
import &#x22;clarity-icons/shapes/essential-shapes&#x22;;
import &#x22;clarity-icons/shapes/social-shapes&#x22;;
import &#x22;clarity-icons/shapes/technology-shapes&#x22;;</code></pre>


        Now, with Clarity v0.9.15 release, you can load all shapes by importing a single set,
        <code class="clr-code">all-shapes</code>:


        <pre><code clr-code-highlight="language-ts" ngNonBindable>
import &#x22;clarity-icons&#x22;;
import &#x22;clarity-icons/shapes/all-shapes&#x22;;</code></pre>
    </li>
</ul>

<h2>Breaking Changes</h2>
<ul class="list-unstyled whats-new-highlights">
    <li breaking-change>
        <h6>New category sets for Clarity Icons</h6>
        <p>With Clarity Icons v0.10.0-alpha.6, we have introduced new category sets such as Commerce, Media, and Travel
            for Clarity Icons. Also, starting with v0.10.0-alpha.6, we will try to avoid shipping the same icon shapes
            in different categories so if they were duplicated in mulitiple sets, those duplicates have been removed. To
            see the new categories and the change of duplicated icons' removal, please refer to our updated
            <a href="https://vmware.github.io/clarity/documentation/iconography">Iconography page.</a>

    <li bug-fix breaking-change>
        <h6>Fixed an issue with datagrid action bar click target.</h6>
        This fix is a breaking change as
        the space reserved for datagrid action bar is removed. Hiding the datagrid action bar
        will now cause the datagrid to move on the page. Our UX team recommends to disable the
        datagrid action bar instead of hiding it completely as it avoids progressive discovery.
