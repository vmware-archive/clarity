                    To follow a common webpack convention, the clarity-angular umd file will be moved into the bundles
                    folder after 0.11.0 is released. If you are using SystemJS, you will need to update the main file
                    for clarity-angular when upgrading to 0.11 because the present location has been deprecated.
