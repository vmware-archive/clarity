        <h6>Whole row selection in datagrid</h6>
        <p>
            Now Datagrid supports selecting rows by clicking anywhere in the grid row. Note that this is not recommended
            when the rows are containing clickable cells. If your cells contain input, buttons, etc. this option is not recommended.
            For row selection mode add <code class="clr-code">[(clDgRowSelection)]</code> and set it to <code class="clr-code">true</code>.
