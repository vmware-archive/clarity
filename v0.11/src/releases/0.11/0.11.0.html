        <h6>Deprecated Entities</h6>
        <p>While not a breaking change, Clarity has deprecate many older clarity entity names (components, directives, services) as a move to align the Clarity codebase with a standardize naming convention across components. Both names are available during the 0.11.x release cycle, allowing you to migrate over the release before they are removed in 0.12.x.</p>
