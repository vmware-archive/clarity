        <h6>Date Picker</h6>
        <p>
            Clarity NG now provides a Date Picker Component. Date Picker can be enabled as shown below:
        </p>
        <pre><code clr-code-highlight="language-html">
&lt;input type=&quot;date&quot; clrDate/&gt;</code></pre>
        <p>
            The initial version of the Date Picker uses locale identifiers supported by Angular to display the dates according to the
            locale date format. It also supports features like keyboard navigation, navigating to the previous, current and
            next month. For more details please refer to the
            <a href="https://vmware.github.io/clarity/documentation/v0.11/datepicker" target="_blank">
                Date Picker documentation
            </a>.

        <h6>Optimize Clarity Icons in your application</h6>
        <p>
            Before
            <code class="clr-code">v0.11.8</code>, users had to import the whole icons sets even if they needed to use only a few icons from those sets. Now with
            <code class="clr-code">v0.11.8</code>, users can import each icon shapes as individual modules and add them to the Clarity Icons API. Leveraging this
            new method of importing icons with Tree-shaking process, you can make a significant optimization to the size
            of Clarity Icons in your application. For example, if you need to use
            <code class="clr-code">car</code>,
            <code class="clr-code">pin</code>, and
            <code class="clr-code">star</code> icons in an application, you can import and add them in the following way:
        </p>

<pre><code clr-code-highlight="language-ts">
import &#123; ClarityIcons &#125; from &quot;@clr/icons&quot;;
import &#123; ClrShapePin &#125; from &quot;@clr/icons/shapes/essential-shapes&quot;;
import &#123; ClrShapeStar &#125; from &quot;@clr/icons/shapes/social-shapes&quot;;
import &#123; ClrShapeCar &#125; from &quot;@clr/icons/shapes/travel-shapes&quot;;

ClarityIcons.add(&#123;
    pin: ClrShapePin,
    star: ClrShapeStar,
    car: ClrShapeCar
&#125;);
</code></pre>
        <p>
            You can see that each shape modules have <code class="clr-code">ClrShape</code> prefix in the example above. An important thing to note here is that,
            to take advantage of this new method, you should only load Clarity Icons by importing it from
            <code class="clr-code">"@clr/icons"</code> and make sure that you are not loading it via a script tag or in some other manner.
