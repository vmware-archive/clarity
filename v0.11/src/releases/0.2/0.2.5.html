        <h6>Build Clarity Seed</h6>
        <p>
            This is a seed project for angular 2 apps using Clarity. The goal of this project is to offer a self-contained "getting started" project for any team
that wishes to build an angular 2 application using Clarity. We included the features that we think are 'common' for all projects, while giving room for
individuals to easily extend it to fit their project's specific needs. The build system written with gulp and the npm scripts simply run the corresponding gulp commands.
