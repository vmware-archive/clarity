<h2>Breaking Changes</h2>

    <li breaking-change>
        <h6>Update Clarity to use BS4 alpha 3</h6>
        <p>
            Clarity has been upgraded to use BS4 Alpha 3. This allows users of Clarity to take advantage of the new BS for functionality with the flex box grid. With Alpha 3, BS4 rewrote some of the classnames related to their grid. Users of Clarity who were using
            Push, pull, offset classes May need to replace the old class names with the new format. More information is available in the
            <a href="http://v4-alpha.getbootstrap.com/layout/grid/#example-offsetting-columns" target="_blank">BS4 documentation</a>.

        <h6>Cleanup baselineRem() and rpx() SASS function calls</h6>
        <p>
            The <code class="clr-code">rpx()</code> SASS function has been removed from Clarity. Make sure to replace it with a measurement in pixels. For example, <code class="clr-code">padding-top: rpx(2)</code> would become <code class="clr-code">padding-top: 2px</code>.
        </p>
    </li>
    <li breaking-change>
        <h6>Typography updates - Implementation: HTML/CSS</h6>
        <p>
            Clarity's typography has been completely redone. It is imperative that all applications upgrading to 0.4.0 verify any customizations they had previously made to Clarity's font specs. Our own internal upgrades involved minimal changes to existing CSS overrides.
            Nevertheless, Clarity strongly advises all users to visually check their applications after upgrading.
        </p>
        <p>
            More information on SASS/SCSS convenience functions that have been added to Clarity to assist with the use of typography can be found in the typography documentation.
