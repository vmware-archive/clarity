                        While this is not a breaking change, product teams that do not
                        want accessible outlines in their applications should review
                        any impact this change had to determine if they want to override
                        the outline style on their own.

            The Clarity team implemented accessible outline highlighting for keyboard navigation. Previously, Clarity UI had overridden the default. There may be an impact for applications that had relied on the default override. In those cases, developers should
            implement their own override. The Clarity team removed the override because it hindered accessibility.

        <h6>Update visited links color</h6>
        <p>
            The visited link text color has been changed. Just a heads up that there's a slightly different shade of purple in use. Those who were already overriding the visited link text color should not be impacted.
