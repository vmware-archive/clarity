<h2>Highlights</h2>
<ul class="list-unstyled whats-new-highlights">
    <li>
        <h6>
            New icons for Clarity Icons
        </h6>
        <p>
            With 0.8.10, Clarity has introduced new icons such as network-globe, network-switch, flow-chart, chat-bubble, etc.
        </p>

    <li>
        <h6>New Datagrid styles</h6>

        <p>
            Our Datagrid styles changed from a table layout to a flexbox one, without any changes required for existing
            integrations. If you were reaching deep into the internal datagrid template to customize its styles (which
            we do
            not recommend), you are at risk of these customizations not working anymore.
        </p>
        <p>
            These new styles will allow us to implement new advanced features for Datagrid, especially animated ones.
            Watch out for expandable rows, they are coming in very soon!
            In the meantime, these new styles already allow two very useful additional features out-of-the-box:
        </p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h6>Datagrid scrolling</h6>
        <p>
            Datagrids can now scroll easily if you set their height. The header and footer stay fixed, only the body
            containing the rows scrolls. It's as simple as setting the height of the <code class="clr-code">&lt;clr-datagrid&gt;</code>
            element to a specific value, or making it 100% to fill its container:
        </p>
<pre><code clr-code-highlight="language-html">
&lt;div id=&quot;my-container&quot;&gt;
    &lt;clr-datagrid&gt;...&lt;/clr-datagrid&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>

<pre><code clr-code-highlight="language-css">
#my-container clr-datagrid &#123;
    height: 100%;
&#125;
</code></pre>
    </li>
    <li>
        Specifying a header's width in any way, including through CSS with a simple class,
        locks the corresponding column size and makes it non-flexible.
        No need to duplicate that information on the cells, just the header is enough.
    </li>
</ul>
