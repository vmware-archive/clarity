        <h6>Clarity Component Modularization</h6>
        <p>
            With 0.9.5, Clarity now ships its components in their own individual Angular modules. Thus, you can load a specific NgModule for each Clarity component that your app uses. For example, if your app uses Datagrid and Modal components you can import their modules as follows:
        </p>
<pre>
    <code clr-code-highlight="language-typescript">
import &#123; ClrDatagridModule, ClrModalModule &#125; from "clarity-angular";</code></pre>
    </li>
    <li>
        <h6>New Clarity wizard final</h6>
        <p>Since its beta release with 0.9.0, the Clarity wizard has had code coverage enhanced by nearly 400 unit tests, has had a full CSS regression test suite added, has had extensive code documentation added to its major components and providers, and has had several features and bugs addressed.</p>
        <p>The Clarity team has put a lot of time and effort into the new wizard component. Keep an eye out for improved documentation in the near future! For the time being, there are many demos, code examples, and extensive documentation on the current website for you.</p>
