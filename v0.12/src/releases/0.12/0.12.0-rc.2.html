<h2>Bug Fixes</h2>
<ul class="list">
    <li bug-fix>
        Updated paths for theme SCSS files so developers can again use custom themes. Apps must now add
        <code class="clr-code"><span class="nobr">--include-path=node_modules</span></code> to their SCSS build step to correctly build a custom theme. See Themes documentation for more details. (<a href="https://github.com/vmware/clarity/pull/2336"
