<h2>Highlights</h2>
<ul class="list-unstyled whats-new-highlights">
    <li>
        <h6 breaking-change>Removal of `forRoot` and `forChild` in ClarityModule</h6>
        <p>
            Clarity has had deprecated methods for the ClarityModule, both which have been removed in this release. They are not utilized and if you use them just simply remove them so anywhere you import Clarity should just be <code class="clr-code">ClarityModule</code> in your imports array.
        </p>
        <h6>Support for Angular CLI <code class="clr-code">ng update</code></h6>
        <p>
            Clarity can now be updated using Angular CLI v6+ by simply running the following:
            <code class="clr-code">ng update @clr/angular@next</code>. The
            <code class="clr-code">@next</code> tag is necessary only while Clarity 0.13 is in prerelease, afterwards it won't be necessary. You can use this
            with any Angular CLI project, even if you've already started to work on it. You may need to run <code class="clr-code">ng update @angular/core</code> first to update Angular.
        </p>
        <h6>Select component</h6>
        <p>The new forms now have a Select component, which provides validation and behaviors for the HTML select element.</p>
        <h6>Datagrid Typing</h6>
        <p>You can now pass in stronger typing information into Datagrid components. See <a href="https://github.com/vmware/clarity/pull/2347" target="_blank">PR 2347</a> for more details.
