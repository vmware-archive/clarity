<h2>Breaking Changes</h2>

    <h6>Upgrade BS4 to Alpha 5</h6>
    <p>
      Clarity has been upgraded to the latest alpha version of Bootstrap
      4: Bootstrap 4, alpha 5. In its latest alpha release, the Bootstrap
      team has changed a number of utility classes — like
      <code class="clr-code">float-*-left</code> instead of
      <code class="clr-code">pull-*-left</code>. In some cases, this may
      constitute a breaking change for applications that were dependent
      on the old utility classnames. <a

    <h6>Move Clarity to the Metropolis font</h6>
    <p>
      As a precaution, make sure to check out your application after
      upgrading to ClarityUI 0.6.0 to make sure the change to the
      Metropolis font hasn’t had a negative impact on your application.
      Metropolis is very close to the previous font that Clarity was
      using but it is a different font. The Clarity team have not
      encountered any negative side effects with the font change but want
      to promote awareness around it.
